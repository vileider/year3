# Advantages and Disadvantages of Full Disk Encryption:

Advantages:
* Enhanced protection of data by encrypting the entire disk.
* Limits unauthorized access to sensitive information.
* Increases security by requiring authentication for access.

Disadvantages:
* The challenge of securely storing encryption keys.
* Potential risk if the encryption key is lost, leading to data loss or inaccessibility.

# Should Full Disk Encryption be Used for Laptops?
Full disk encryption should be utilized for laptops due to its significant security benefits. By encrypting the entire disk, it ensures that data remains protected in case of theft or loss.

# Guest Lecture Highlights:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
* Utilizes authentication methods such as QR codes or authenticator apps on phones.

Zero Trust Approach:
* Assumes that the firewall has been breached.
* Emphasizes continuous verification and least privilege access.
* Requires systems to be kept up to date to mitigate risks.

Making Changes:
* Sensitive changes may require approval.
* Access to the system is restricted, and changes are tracked through processes like GitHub.

Updating Sensitive Data:
* Requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access.
* Encrypted files on disk ensure data security.
* Access to decryption keys is restricted based on user permissions.

Access to Files:
* Access to files is restricted, and user permissions are carefully managed.
* Encrypted files add an additional layer of security.
Storing Data:
* Consistency of tables is maintained by storing numerical data.

Preventing Bad SQL Statements:
* Periodically collect and analyze SQL statements to identify and * mitigate potential risks.

Giving Access to Databases:
* Utilize groups for easier management of permissions.
* Roles can be assigned based on various factors such as logon user ID, IP address, and TLS usage.

Protecting PDF Files:
* Encrypt PDFs using a symmetric key.
* Encrypt the symmetric key using the recipient's public key.
* The recipient decrypts the symmetric key using their private key and then decrypts the PDF for viewing.
