## 22.11.2023 -John Collett: Critical Thinking


John advised me not to undermine the argument with logical fallacies such as:

Ad hominem,(Attacking the person)
The slippery slope fallacy (if we allow one thing, it will lead to an undesirable outcome),
Straw man (the least convincing way to dismiss an argument).
He emphasized that whenever I am contemplating an issue or concept, I should strive to be aware of my thinking.

The more I feed my mind with different concepts, the more it is challenged to adapt and learn, leading to an improvement in my critical thinking.

Critical thinking is a reflective practice but should not become a negatively spiraling one. I should connect critical thinking to different contexts to understand where it occurs in the real world.

In project management, the ability to analyze project aims, objectives, and goals and formulate strategies to achieve them is crucial. However, all projects encounter problems along the way, making project management as much about planning for and dealing with these issues as it is about following a plan.

Design thinking is commonly said to involve five stages:

Empathize: Research users' needs,
Define: State users' needs and problems,
Ideate: Challenge assumptions and create ideas,
Prototype: Start creating solutions,
Test: Try out the solutions.
Each stage of design thinking requires critical thinking.

Critical thinking is a practice that needs to be developed and refined. Everyone has the capacity to engage and develop their critical thinking. It's essential to be aware of thinking biases and logical fallacies. If nothing shifts in perspective the first couple of times, there's no need to worry. Patience and perseverance are key.
