# 12.09.2023 meeting with Neil

In the meeting with Neil, one of the teaching staff members, several key points were discussed:

Learning Outcomes: Neil mentioned that our learning outcomes are primarily focused on project management, although they won't be emphasized further.

Team Building Project: Neil expressed interest in creating a project that would foster team collaboration.

Big Data Analysis Project: There's a big data analysis project in the pipeline, which is beneficial as it can be reused in other projects and provide evidence for learning outcomes.

Managing Multiple Projects: It's expected that as third-year students, we will be managing multiple projects simultaneously.

Research Department: Neil shared that the research department has funding available for software projects. Some projects involve working with prominent clients, including one related to React.

Potential Projects: There are several potential projects in the pipeline, such as a swimming mapping application (with potential use of a Node server and authentication), a machine learning app, a project retrieving data from Frazer (a service), and an AI-related project.

Application Process: To apply for these projects, we should send an email to Sam Scott with the phrase "I would like to apply..."

Course Project: Neil also mentioned the idea of a course project. This project involves creating documentation, essentially a guide on how to navigate the course. It would cover topics like how to get started, managing a portfolio, and best practices over time. Python mkdoc for documentation purposes would be essential.
It would essentially function as a Wikipedia for students.

Question about non trivial data. A non-trivial example would involve comparing, analyzing data from two different sourcesand and swering the question why.
