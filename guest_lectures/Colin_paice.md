Colin Paice TLS(SS) End-to-end Encryption

One-way function

Two keys: I can encrypt with the 1st key or I can encrypt with the 2nd key and then encrypt with the 1st key. Anyone who wants to send me an encrypted message uses the public key, and I can decrypt it with only my private key.
Public and private keys are based on prime numbers.

Colin says the government is storing all internet encrypted traffic data, and once quantum computers are efficient enough, it will be possible to decrypt everything from the past.

A certificate is like a document with a name, city, start and end date, public key, and IP address.

How to prevent intercepted traffic:

The sender and receiver each have an individual key received from each other. Then, during encrypted transmission, two common keys are mixed with one individual key, and the decrypted message is returned.
