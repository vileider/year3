Colin Paice TLS(SS) End-to-end Encryption

One way function

- two keys
  i can encroipt with 1st keay or i can ecripot with 2nd key and encript with 1 key
  anyone who want to sent me encripted message uses public key and i can decript it with only my private key

Public and private key are based on priome numbers

Collin say the goverment is storing all internet encrypted trafiic data
and once quantum computer will be efficient enought. It will be possible to decript everything from the past.

Certificate is like document with a name, city, start and end date
public key and ip adress.

How to prevent interception trafic

senedr and reciever have 1 idividual key that recieved from each other

than while encrypted transmission 2 common key are mixed with 1 idividual key
and return decrypted message
