Question 1:
What method of data analysis did you employ to understand why people do not use meters, and what were the findings? Was there anything that surprised you?

Answer:
Vishnu began with exploratory analysis, focusing on customer profiling parameters. They identified customers and their income levels. Through clustering in the data, they discerned patterns among the customers who were reluctant to use meters. For instance, those customers often lived in old houses and came from lower-income backgrounds. This led them to contemplate strategies to increase meter usage among this demographic.

Question 2:

Question 3:
If and why is data analytics strategically important in the decision-making processes of businesses?

When you have a large dataset, companies might not know what to do with it due to its size, yet they hope to utilize it in the future. This is where data analytics becomes crucial. Vishnu is skilled at identifying and interpreting results. In data analytics, he deals with a lot of data and initially may not know how to leverage it. However, a good data analyst knows how to extract meaningful insights from the data.

To make decisions as a corporate entity, whether to increase profits or implement improvements within the company, these enhancements can't be made by just getting the idea of changing something. For instance, if there's a website, he would probably analyze the traffic and its sources.

The reporting tools he uses include:

Tableau
Microsoft Power BI
QlikView
He suggests using Microsoft Excel as well.
