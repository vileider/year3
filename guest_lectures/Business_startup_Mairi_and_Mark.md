Business Start-Up with Mairi Macdonald (RBS) and Mark Sutherland (CodeBase)

<!-- 1. Can you explain how you deal with intellectual property rights while creating software? -->


<!-- 2. Can you explain how you interact with your superiors, higher management and work with colleagues or other departments other organizations? -->


<!-- 3. I conduct research related to AI in the IT industry. During my research, I managed to use GPT to evaluate my flowchart and create user stories. Have you ever heard about using AI to improve the Software Development Life Cycle? -->

I didn't write much about this session because it wasn't strictly about learning outcomes,
but more about starting a company from an idea.
I did not have the opportunity to ask my questions; however, I managed to catch Mark and arrange a meeting for the next day.
