# Prototypes

There are different to iniitiaite new project
As a junior developer i most of the time i will be editing somone eles code not new project
prototypes are different from  MVP
when I am developing a project i should use the code and knowledge I  already have

Summrizing a prototype is the as quack as possible way to demonstrate a proof of concept
