Adam Linson on Designs on Interaction

What makes an intuitive interface?

- Cultural factors can have an impact on intuitive UI. Some cultural groups are ignored by UI designers.

- Biological factors like abilities or disabilities can affect how interfaces are understood by people with better concentration and memory.

- Language or concepts: the different ways that users can understand UI, and UI can be interpreted.

- By creating affordance design, users can intuitively use some buttons or interact with some parts of UI.

- Objects in the UI should meet specific design decisions: the right height, shape, color, and intuitive interaction.

- Software and hardware interaction are governed by design metaphors (positioning email as visualized akin to placing physical mail into a letterbox).
