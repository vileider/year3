Neil on Researching

Whenever I conduct research, I should note the topic I'm investigating. I should create a markdown file named after the subject of my research and document my findings.

If I can't find what I'm looking for, I should rephrase or try adding more keywords to the search phrase.

Research sources:

YouTube
Documentation
MDM docs for JavaScript
UHI library, academic journals
When examining a resource, I need to check the date it was posted.

I mentioned that ideally, I try to find three sources that confirm each other's statements.

When tackling a significant problem, I try to rephrase it and break it down into smaller parts, addressing them one by one.

Find resources
Determine if a resource is authoritative
It is essential to determine what aids in searching quicker: already known sources or a tendency for some websites to describe just one side of the story, having trusted sources like Google Scholars.

The process begins when I'm interested in a topic.
Then, as soon as I become curious, I should write down what I already know. I should articulate why I'm curious and pose some questions related to the subject.

The description of the problem can be much clearer in academic resources.
