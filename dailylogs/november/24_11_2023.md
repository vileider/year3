### 24.11.2023
Throughout the whole morning, I had a series of meetings. The first one was the 21-22 cohort weekly standup, and during the meeting with Maheshi and Karen, I described my current tasks and outlined the plan for the upcoming weeks. Following that, I joined the webchat team, providing advice on code practices and sharing my code repository with examples similar to their current tasks to aid in problem-solving. Subsequently, I participated in a planning and backlog population meeting with the Security Outcome team, where we completed user stories and utilized the tasks generated during planning to populate the backlog on our Kanban Jira board. After this meeting, I had a discussion with Neil regarding my pursuit of a software engineering job and received insights on how to enhance my chances of securing one.
