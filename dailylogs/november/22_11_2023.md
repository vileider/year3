I contemplated how to address the issue with the React app. I reached the conclusion that the optimal solution would be to create a new repository and focus on the frontend there. I fixed the React code sufficiently to make it run and generated a build. Taking that build, I placed it into our server repository. By simply modifying the server path, we can now run the frontend as the server operates. I watched two tutorials about creating game in python to prepeare myself for the python project I commit to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H09PmP5tsy8, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY&t=812s. I understand how to create basic background and how to import the right library.
I attenede to johns guest lecture. He provided valuable insights into the importance of critical thinking, emphasizing its application in various real-world scenarios such as project management and design thinking. The emphasis on developing and refining critical thinking as a practice resonated well. I started a reflection related to designing and developing software. This guest lecture will be used as a one of my knowledge sources. I have joined the mural of the game project. I also started another ticket for my portfolio project, where I added links to social media icons. Currently, they are hardcoded, but I plan to change it so that the links to social media will be read from 'portfolio.tsx'.
