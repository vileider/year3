Today, since the morning, I tried to fix the React app created for the Security Outcome project. Although the frontend wasn't included in the project specification, it was developed by one of the participants. I had to search through different branches and gather fragments of code to consolidate them. In the end, I discovered multiple 'node_modules', and the code did not run even with the instructions provided at https://copyprogramming.com/howto/run-create-react-app-from-sub-folder.
I believe the best solution is to separate the React app into its own folder. Once the build is created, I can run it from the server in the main repository. On another note, I added references and corrected grammar and spelling mistakes in my reflection.
Before the end of the day, I met up with a new game project member from college and outside the school to discuss the tools we will use and organize the work
