Most of the day, I was reviewing the code at the Security Outcome project. We also had a long planning and retrospective session where we revamped the epics, user stories, and tasks. I hope everything is much clearer now. I believe that every retrospective brings a clearer vision of the project goal. I met up with Karen, and we discussed the plan for developing my learning process. I came back to my private project. In the new section at 'portfolio.tsx', links to social media will be nested in that file and not hardcoded in next app. I also connected to repository and board at new gamer related project.
