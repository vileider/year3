After a quick conversation on the Slack channel, a team member informed me that there is no table for unsecured routes, but there is a population database script. I found the script on an unmerged branch. After investigating, I noticed that the script did not have the necessary files to run it. I will need to fix the entire branch and make it executable. I will try to find time to do this in the evening. I received an email from Aviva suggesting that I move to the next stage of the recruiting process. It was a programming challenge that took me 90 minutes plus 45 minutes of preparation. I managed to finish the reflection on business processes, and I am surprised that it is divided into so many parts that are really dependent on each other.
