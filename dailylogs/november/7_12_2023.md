I started my day by learning Python through a 12-hour course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
I moved some tickets on the linear board and reviewed pull requests from other participants. I had an asynchronous stand-up, and we agreed to have a retrospective and planning session the next day at 13:00. In the afternoon, I worked on my reflection on the presentation.
