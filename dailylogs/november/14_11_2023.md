In the morning, I faced challenges with the database populator as the branch was multiple commits behind. To resolve this, I organized a meeting with a team member and explained how working on branches functions. I clarified the usage of package.json and shared best practices and solutions related to the project. I demonstrated how to add scripts to an existing project, which successfully fixed the issue related to the ticket, and a pull request was made appropriately. Reflecting on this, I realized that considering project participants' skills when starting a new project would save time and prevent the need to explain basic topics repeatedly.
I wrote a significant portion of the reflection about standards. I learned that various ISO standards guide me to deliver better quality products.
On the technical side, I updated the Twitter logo on my portfolio website, changing it to 'X'. I also added styles and a bottom-line section on the ABOUT ME subpage.
