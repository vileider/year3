Today, from the morning, I continued reviewing Pull Requests related to secured routes. With a fresh mind, I noticed that in the Pull Request I accepted yesterday, I found missing files and folders crucial for the project. Another issue arose when I discovered that the tickets moved to the "done" column were never merged with the main branch. I attempted to create a Git request to the database but noticed there is no table or schema in the database. While creating a script, I referred to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createschema.html.

Simultaneously, I was learning about business processes from https://www.villanovau.com/articles/bpm/what-is-a-business-process/ to write my reflection.
