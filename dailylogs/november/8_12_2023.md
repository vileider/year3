I focused on reflecting on my presentation and made a significant update to my reflection related to the presentation.
The entire Friday and weekend, I was learning Python from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=7684s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8&t=2535s. I found that I have trouble understanding classes in Python. I will aim to learn that in the next couple of days.
