I started the day by reviewing a pull request, and I approved it. I didn't find any major problems with the database populator. After that, I continued with my ticket 45, where I successfully returned a GET request from an unsecured database. I also noticed that the assumptions for GET requests in unsecured and secured databases differ. I pointed this out in the security-outcome channel and created a pull request for my task, which was approved within a couple of minutes.
I continued my reflection based on the learning outcomes of the quality standards subject. I found a website that allows me to test my website against various standards, and, most importantly, it's free. I summarized the results and found it interesting that my website meets high standards. I am happy that I could write decent code.
I almost finished the 'About Me' section. I think I will complete it tomorrow; it just needs a couple of small bits.
