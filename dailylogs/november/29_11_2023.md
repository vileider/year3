I spent the entire day working on the security-outcome project. I encountered challenges with the slider and nesting components within it. However, by making style adjustments in CSS, I was able to make progress. In the afternoon, I attended a guest lecture by Eleanor Rutherford on Leadership. Later, I participated in discussions addressing issues related to the farm-game.
