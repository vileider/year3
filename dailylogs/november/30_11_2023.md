Today, much like throughout the entire week, I dedicated my time to the Security Outcome project. With the assistance of Gracjan, I successfully completed UI routes for both GET and POST requests. Simultaneously, I began preparing a pitch for the upcoming presentation of our project. Following the all-hands meeting, I continued working on the presentation for the portfolio project scheduled for the next day at 10:20.
