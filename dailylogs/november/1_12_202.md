In the morning, I had a meeting with Karen and Macheshi, who provided valuable feedback on the presentation from the previous day. Karen commended the small demo of the project and highlighted the significance of understanding user stories for effective communication with non-technical individuals. She emphasized the importance of learning lessons about project estimation, noting that not finishing on time is an opportunity to improve planning and develop backup plans for unexpected obstacles.

Macheshi introduced the concept of a "change management plan," which I need to delve into for a deeper understanding. Later, during the portfolio project presentation, technical issues unexpectedly arose, preventing me from showcasing the entire project. Amid the presentation, I discovered that my website was down.

Subsequently, I collaborated with my friend Jason to fix the pipelines. We added a Docker image to the pipeline, and through this process, I learned that the issue with my website was caused by a deleted SSH certificate key. It seems the keys were nested in the wrong folder previously. This time, we ensured the keys were in the correct location. The website is now up and running, and I'm hopeful that the issue won't recur.
