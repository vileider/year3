Today, I began by writing asynchronous daily updates on the Slack channel. I continued working on the user interface for the Security Outcome project, successfully creating sliding cards for requests. Tomorrow, I plan to further enhance the interface by adding input fields and more interactive elements. In the afternoon, I met with a Python game team member and initiated planning by dividing epics into user stories and tasks. Following that, I had a discussion with my mentor who recommended pursuing an AWS certificate.
