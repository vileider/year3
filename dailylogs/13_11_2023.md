I successfully added the package.json file and installed all dependencies for the database populator. I discovered that I can find database credentials on the Outcome Team's Slack channel.
I initiated a reflection on software quality standards.
Additionally, I watched a video about PostgreSQL from Fireship.
I also made some small progress on my portfolio website.
