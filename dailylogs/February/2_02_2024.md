I began by finalizing the reflection related to the senior leadership team. Additionally, I had a meeting with my team members where we collaborated on creating a flowchart.
During this period, I came across an insightful article titled "Refactoring is Good, Refactoring Stories Are Not" from this source:

From this article, I learned that refactoring tickets should not be added to user stories, as "Refactoring stories fundamentally do not add value, and from a prioritization perspective, they will never be equal in status to a business feature."
As a result of this insight, I have decided to suggest refactoring when a ticket is being considered for action in the future.
