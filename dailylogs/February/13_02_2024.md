From the morning, I was working on LO3.7.2.3 and looked at it from another angle. I searched the internet, Google Scholar, and the UHI library for useful articles and books. I attended a lecture with Neil about OOP, and it helped consolidate my knowledge on that topic. I had a mentoring session, and on top of free industry discussions, I asked him about one of the learning outcomes and for some guidance related to design patterns in my project. He also explained to me in simple words what a factory pattern is. After mentoring, I had a long pair programming session where we were defining abstraction layers.
