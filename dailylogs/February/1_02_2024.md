I conducted research related to Learning Outcome 3.7.2.3 and documented my findings.
I was called upon to address an issue with an app that my employer had been using during my internship. After a thorough investigation, I created a report detailing the problem and presented it to the company owner. Additionally, I successfully resolved the issue.
During this process, I emphasized the importance of upgrading the app and addressing existing bugs. I also expressed my willingness to continue improving the app in the future.
