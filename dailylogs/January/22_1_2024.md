The initial meeting of the second semester went quickly and was understandable. In the 3rd semester, we received a task to create a report from the 1st semester and plan for the second. I started LO 3722 and created a plan on how to approach it. I took and finished another ticket for the farming game project. During the meeting with Neill at 2, we discussed our approach for the next semester and how we understand the learning outcomes. After 4, we met with Charles, and he gave us some hints on how we can improve our code.
