### 23.1.2024
STAND UP:
Started working on the current project's outcome.
Completed a ticket in the project I am currently working on.
I met up with Charles and Gracjan. We noted a lot of advice from him. Today, I will try to put his advice into practice during the planning session. After that, I will aim to complete the current outcome I am working on in half the time.
AFTER DAILY STANDUP WITH STUDENTS, I WENT TO A PLANNING SESSION, AND WE PLANNED NEXT TASKS FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS.
I had a refactoring session that took too long.
I think it should be organized better.
