STAND UP: Today, I aim to complete the refactoring task and continue working on the learning outcome I planned to address yesterday. If I have additional time, I'll pick up another ticket in the project.
I started refactoring, and after 15 minutes of my team member trying to figure out what went wrong, I decided to erase the branch and start the refactoring process systematically, addressing each aspect one by one.
I realize the importance of being more persuasive when suggesting best practices. Even seemingly simple tasks like refactoring and organizing the catalog structure should be approached systematically and with a well-thought-out plan.
In my progress reflection, I acknowledge that while I have made progress in refactoring the code, there is still some work that needs to be done.
