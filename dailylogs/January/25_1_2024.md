Stand up:
I erased previous refactoring branch and started from the beggining, systematicaly fixing class by class following solid principles.
I did some progress in my reflection.
today i hope to finish refactor and start another reflection because i need to wait for my mentoring session to finish prevous one
We moved forward in refactor and we managed to  separate methods in classes,
I strted a new refelction about the research
