On my first day of school, each one of us students introduced ourselves. After a quick introduction, Neil led a short session on what makes a good stand-up. Following that, each of us began discussing what we had been working on, our upcoming plans, and any challenges we were facing.

In the afternoon, I successfully implemented automation into my portfolio project. During a voice chat session, my friend and I introduced two bots to our Discord serverâ€”one from Jira and the other from GitHub

On Thursday, I participated in a guest lecture session with John from IBM. Following the lecture, we were divided into groups. Unfortunately, my group consisted of people who weren't interested in contributing, so I decided to leave the group and continued working on my private project.

Over the weekend, I dedicated my time to my portfolio project. I had a meeting with one of my team members where we discussed issues related to upcoming tasks. During this meeting, I realized that I had unintentionally worked on something unrelated to my assigned task. To resolve this, we decided to merge the work I had already done into the development branch and rebase the branch that my friend was working on to the updated development branch. Fortunately, this process went smoothly because we maintain a respectful and collaborative approach towards both the project and each other.

I began working on the Drystone project. I established a Jira board and configured the appropriate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages. I then initiated work on the project's user interface (UI).
During the afternoon, I continued my work on the portfolio project. I focused on adding styles and ensuring that the concept I've created remains consistent and well-defined. 
### 5.9.2023
I successfully completed the basic user interface (UI) for the Drystane project. Additionally, I made further enhancements to my private project.
### 6.9.2023
I made good progress today. I successfully implemented a basic script and began debugging events in the school project. For my private portfolio project, I continued to work on styling and added the JSX structure. Additionally, I initiated a reflection related to project time management.
