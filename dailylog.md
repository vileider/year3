### 30.08.2023
On my first day of school, each one of us students introduced ourselves. After a quick introduction, Neil led a short session on what makes a good stand-up. Following that, each of us began discussing what we had been working on, our upcoming plans, and any challenges we were facing.
#
In the afternoon, I successfully implemented automation into my portfolio project. During a voice chat session, my friend and I introduced two bots to our Discord serverâ€”one from Jira and the other from GitHub
### 31.8-3.9.2023
On Thursday, I participated in a guest lecture session with John from IBM. Following the lecture, we were divided into groups. Unfortunately, my group consisted of people who weren't interested in contributing, so I decided to leave the group and continued working on my private project.
#
Over the weekend, I dedicated my time to my portfolio project. I had a meeting with one of my team members where we discussed issues related to upcoming tasks. During this meeting, I realized that I had unintentionally worked on something unrelated to my assigned task. To resolve this, we decided to merge the work I had already done into the development branch and rebase the branch that my friend was working on to the updated development branch. Fortunately, this process went smoothly because we maintain a respectful and collaborative approach towards both the project and each other. 
### 4.9.2023
I began working on the Drystone project. I established a Jira board and configured the appropriate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages. I then initiated work on the project's user interface (UI).
During the afternoon, I continued my work on the portfolio project. I focused on adding styles and ensuring that the concept I've created remains consistent and well-defined. 
### 5.9.2023
I successfully completed the basic user interface (UI) for the Drystane project. Additionally, I made further enhancements to my private project.
### 6.9.2023
I made good progress today. I successfully implemented a basic script and began debugging events in the school project. For my private portfolio project, I continued to work on styling and added the JSX structure. Additionally, I initiated a reflection related to project time management. 
### 7.9.2023
I had a productive day. I completed the ticket and created a Pull Request for my private project. Following that, I continued searching for evidence to support my reflection. In the Drystane project, I successfully connected the script to the UI and managed to pass values from one textbox to another.
### 8-10.9.2023
Over the weekend, I dedicated time to improving my application and working on my reflection.
### 12.09.2023
During the "Stand Up" meeting, Christopher mentioned that he's capable of providing assistance in languages like C++, C#, and Python, as well as general programming and compiling tasks. He also pointed out that non-trivial data analysis can be performed using Google Colab and Google BigQuery, involving tasks such as uploading CSV files and conducting data analysis.
# 13.9.2023
Today, I managed to finish the project specification, but I would like to check if it is made in the proper way, so I added a ticket on the Jira board.
#
After two hours of focused effort, I successfully completed the application form for the Research Assistant position at Moray UHI and I'm excited about the opportunity.
### 14.9.2023
I successfully synchronized my repositories on GitHub and Bitbucket. Now, any changes I push to GitHub will automatically be mirrored on Bitbucket. This streamlined process will save me time and ensure that my work is consistently backed up.
### 15-17.9.2023
I have found 2 APIs for data analysis. I just need to find one more. I sent 1 pull request for my private project, and I managed to resolve merging conflicts during Sunday's meeting.
### 18-20.9.2023
In the last couple of days, I have been working on a school project related to reflection. I changed my concept, and I am now receiving data from a CSV file and displaying it on the screen. As for my portfolio project, I am currently focused on displaying data that describes past projects and presenting it in the right format within JSX components.
### 21-27.9.2023 
"Over the past week, I've been diligently working on my non-trivial data project, and I successfully managed to create a proof of concept. I displayed two different datasets in the form of charts and could summarize what is presented on the screen.
#
In regard to my private project, I conducted a significant refactor and reorganized the catalog structure. On top of that, I implemented troubleshooting functionality. Whenever the application can't read data from the user, it will use default data, and the same goes for images. If the app cannot find images for the project, it will utilize default ones. Currently, I'm facing a semi-difficult rebase due to all these changes.
### 28.9 - 06.10.2023
Over the last week, I have been working diligently on my portfolio project, and I am close to finishing the alpha version of it. Additionally, I have started a project with a group of students related to security and risks. During a meeting with Neil, I gained an understanding of the differences between threats and risks, which will be beneficial for my reflection. I've had several tempting opportunities related to jobs and other projects over the past week. However, I am committed to maintaining discipline and staying systematic, so I will continue working on my current tasks without starting anything new until I complete them.
### 7 -10.10.2023
Over the last week, I made significant progress in deploying my portfolio app. I successfully set up a pipeline to deploy the code on a virtual private server, which required using tools like Nginx and working with port proxy. I did encounter some issues with the hosting provider, but I managed to resolve them. Additionally, I purchased a domain name, and with the assistance of Cloudflare, I can now access my website using the domain name. I also completed approximately 15 tickets during the week and gained valuable experience in React and TypeScript.
