Creating a presentation for my software development project can be a challenging task, but also a rewarding one. I want to showcase my skills, product, and leave my  audience curious, whether they are potential clients, employers, teacher, or students.

I tried to imporve my knowledge of presenting a project and i found scenelab.io  blog website.
# https://scenelab.io/blog/software-project-presentation
The blog post that gives tips on how to make interesting presentations for software projects. It advices to know my audience, define your goal, outline a story, use visuals, and practice and rehearse your presentation. It also shows some examples of how to use images, graphs, charts, diagrams, icons, and mockups to illustrate your points. It also advisesme to check your software, presentation object, and venue before my presentation, and prepare for possible questions or objections from your audience.

I can come to a conclusion just after reading this blog.  On a presentation i had in the past i focused too much on the teachnical aspect forgeting about the audience. I also did not show much visualisatio to ilustrate my project

even if ther was not much to see i could show what i have been doing and talk more about it
II@ think i should speak slower and try to work under my akcent, also i think it is not easy to understand what i ama saying and i shuld 
sound clearer. Overal i think that presentation was ok.
karen when reffering the presentation was able to give feedback on the topic i mentioned
and also mentioned the presentation was much clearer, and was happy to see something what demonstrate my work.
