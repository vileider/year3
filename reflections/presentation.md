# Effectively prepare and deliver presentations using relevant presentation media products, present ideas clearly and convincingly. 

Creating a presentation for my software development project can be a challenging task, but also a rewarding one. I aim to showcase not only my skills and product but also to pique the curiosity of diverse audiences, be they potential clients, employers, teachers, or fellow students.

I tried to improve my knowledge of presenting a project, and I found the scenelab.io blog website: (Henke, 2020)  This insightful blog provides valuable tips on crafting engaging presentations for software projects. It advises me to know my audience, define my goal, outline a story, use visuals, and practice and rehearse my presentation. It also shows some examples of how to use images, graphs, charts, diagrams, icons, and mockups to illustrate points. It also advises me to check my software, presentation object, and venue before my presentation, and prepare for possible questions or objections from my audience.

Reflecting on past experiences, I discerned that in a previous presentation, my focus on technical aspects overshadowed consideration for the audience, and I lacked adequate visualizations to convey the essence of my project.

I had a sprint review of all students' projects combined with the project presentation. I had to demonstrate what my team achieved over the last couple of weeks. I tried hard over the last week to add the visual side of our project following advice from Scenelab. I also prepared a small introduction and organized a time during the presentation. I asked a team member if he could say something while I start sharing my screen and running the app because it can take a while, and I would like to avoid the pause: 
(1. Todorow, 2023)
Although there wasn't much to showcase, I could explain what I have been doing and talk more about it.

I think I should speak slower and try to work on my accent. Also, I think it is not easy to understand what I am saying, and I should sound clearer. Overall, I think that the presentation was okay. Feedback from Karen highlighted the improvement, emphasizing a understandable presentation and appreciation of the presentation was much clearer, and was happy to see something that demonstrates my work.

To further refine my presentation skills, I read the Wikihow article.(Taylor, 2023) 
WikiHow teaches how to deliver effective presentations. I need to prepare well, present confidently, and communicate clearly. I should have a clear and concise message that summarizes my main purpose and objectives. I should practice my presentation in front of someone who can give me feedback and help me overcome my nerves. I read that the use of appropriate visuals, language, and tone would help to support my presentation and engage my audience. Wikihow advises that I should also end my presentation with a strong conclusion and invite questions or feedback from my audience.

I was doing my portfolio project for over 3 months. I intend to create a blueprint for anyone who would like to place all past work in one place. It was a project that was simply to update and was looking decent. I started my presentation but did not test it for a long time: (2. Todorow, 2023) During the presentation, I was struggling to add new modules or run the program. That is supposed to be the main advantage of my app.

I received feedback from one of the students: "Well done, Bogdan! I like that your portfolio has a clean and organized layout. I'm planning to make my own, and I will keep yours in mind. Find some time to correct your scalability. I think, along with the best design, you should also focus on user experience, best practices, and speed optimization. It would also be worth adding your projects and CV. I am sure you will be hired soon. Good Luck."

It is good to notice the positive aspects of my presentation. I should work on a better description of my project. I should explain what it is about and what it is for. I should do fewer stops, and before the presentation, I should practice my presentation. It can be shown that the introduction and summary were okay because I was more prepared for it. I also made a mistake mentioned in scenelab: (Henke, 2023) I should test my software if it is presentable before showing it to the audience. In general, a lot to improve.

Even if on paper and in theory my presentation was good, I did not take the stress factor under my consideration. I started looking for some advice on that and I have found 6 ways to reduce the stress of presenting: (Grenny, 2015) I read that I should balance preparation, taking breaks, and engaging in other activities. Break down lengthy presentations, making tasks more achievable and minimizing anxiety. I should transform presentations into conversations with interactive activities, engaging the audience and providing natural breaks. To create a good presentation, I should identify and address personal stress triggers and utilize controlled breathing techniques. I should practice an original, independent authentic presentation style. If I apply these strategies, I have a big chance to turn presentations into fulfilling opportunities for connection and reduce overall stress.

I think I should approach the presentation more professionally. I should gather all that I have done right and make sure that it will stay this way. After that, I must check what went wrong and try to improve, and polish every aspect. I should test my "new" presentation in front of a small audience or even just one of my friends and then show it to a bigger audience with adjustments if needed.

Effectively preparing and delivering presentations is not as easy as I thought. I was not aware of many factors that made the presentation clear, engaging, and concise. Having that skill can be beneficial in many ways. From now on, I will take this task more seriously, and I will be more prepared for future presentations.
