LO3.7.1.5
Industrial software design
Compare and contrast software design and development methodologies (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to apply appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.

You need to identify similarities and differences between different development methodologies - this means look at terms such as Object Orientated Design or Object Orientated Analysis.  It does NOT mean object orientated coding.  What is a design methodology?  What does it comprise of?  What is a UML diagram?  Why are they used?  Where are they used in industry?  How do you go from the methodology on paper to implementing it?  Can you use different methodologies in different projects to compare their effectiveness?

## what is software design
software design methodologies have been known for me and I wrote couple reflection about it[my past reflections]. I should brefly descibe common design meythologies.
* Agile: A set of principles and values that emphasize iterative, incremental, and collaborative software development. Agile methods aim to deliver working software frequently, respond to changing requirements, and involve customers and users throughout the process.

* Scrum: A software development process that is based on the agile framework, which consists of a set of roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Scrum roles include the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team. Scrum events include the sprint, the sprint planning, the daily scrum, the sprint review, and the sprint retrospective. Scrum artifacts include the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and the increment. Scrum rules define how the roles, events, and artifacts interact and work together.

Scrum and agile is often mistaken called interchangeably.

After 2 years of usage Agile and scrum i understab that Agile is aproject management project management philosphy with set of values or principles. Scrum is a specific Agile methodology. It is good to keep that in mind.

* Waterfall: A linear and sequential software development process that follows a predefined set of phases, such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Waterfall methods assume that the requirements are clear and stable, and that each phase can be completed before moving to the next one. Waterfall methods are often criticized for being rigid, inflexible, and prone to delays and errors.

3 previous have been know  to me and the 1st is often use by me . the next couple are new for me and it is intersitng to get to understand them.

* Feature-driven development (FDD): A software development process that focuses on delivering features that provide business value to the customer. FDD combines some of the best practices of agile and waterfall methods, such as iterative development, frequent releases, quality assurance, and documentation. FDD consists of five main activities: develop an overall model, build a feature list, plan by feature, design by feature, and build by feature.

* Lean: A software development process that is based on the principles of lean manufacturing, which aim to eliminate waste, optimize value, and improve quality. Lean methods focus on delivering the most valuable features to the customer as quickly and efficiently as possible, while minimizing defects, rework, and overhead. Lean methods also emphasize continuous improvement, learning, and feedback.
* Extreme programming (XP): A software development process that is based on the agile framework, which emphasizes high-quality code, frequent releases, customer satisfaction, and teamwork. XP practices include pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, collective ownership, simple design, and user stories.
* Rapid application development (RAD): A software development process that aims to deliver software applications quickly and efficiently, using prototyping, iterative development, and user feedback. RAD methods involve four phases: requirements planning, user design, construction, and cutover. RAD methods are suitable for projects that have changing requirements, short deadlines, and user involvement.

* DevOps: A software development process that integrates development and operations teams, tools, and practices, to enable faster and more reliable delivery of software applications. DevOps methods aim to improve collaboration, communication, automation, and quality across the software development life cycle. DevOps practices include continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous testing, continuous monitoring, and continuous feedback.
