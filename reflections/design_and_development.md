LO3.7.1.5
Industrial software design
Compare and contrast software design and development methodologies (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to apply appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.

You need to identify similarities and differences between different development methodologies - this means look at terms such as Object Orientated Design or Object Orientated Analysis.  It does NOT mean object orientated coding.  What is a design methodology?  What does it comprise of?  What is a UML diagram?  Why are they used?  Where are they used in industry?  How do you go from the methodology on paper to implementing it?  Can you use different methodologies in different projects to compare their effectiveness?

## waht i will do

software development methodologies have been known for me and I wrote couple reflection about it[my past reflections]. I should brefly descibe common design meythologies.
## what is software develoment
* Agile: A set of principles and values that emphasize iterative, incremental, and collaborative software development. Agile methods aim to deliver working software frequently, respond to changing requirements, and involve customers and users throughout the process.
# https://www.easyagile.com/blog/software-development-methodologies/
* Scrum: A software development process that is based on the agile framework, which consists of a set of roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Scrum roles include the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team. Scrum events include the sprint, the sprint planning, the daily scrum, the sprint review, and the sprint retrospective. Scrum artifacts include the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and the increment. Scrum rules define how the roles, events, and artifacts interact and work together.

Scrum and agile is often mistaken called interchangeably.

After 2 years of usage Agile and scrum i understab that Agile is aproject management project management philosphy with set of values or principles. Scrum is a specific Agile methodology. It is good to keep that in mind.
## what is software develoment
* Waterfall: A linear and sequential software development process that follows a predefined set of phases, such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Waterfall methods assume that the requirements are clear and stable, and that each phase can be completed before moving to the next one. Waterfall methods are often criticized for being rigid, inflexible, and prone to delays and errors.

3 previous have been know  to me and the 1st is often use by me . the next couple are new for me and it is intersitng to get to understand them.

* Feature-driven development (FDD): A software development process that focuses on delivering features that provide business value to the customer. FDD combines some of the best practices of agile and waterfall methods, such as iterative development, frequent releases, quality assurance, and documentation. FDD consists of five main activities: develop an overall model, build a feature list, plan by feature, design by feature, and build by feature.
# https://www.upwork.com/resources/most-common-software-development-methodologies
* Lean: A software development process that is based on the principles of lean manufacturing, which aim to eliminate waste, optimize value, and improve quality. Lean methods focus on delivering the most valuable features to the customer as quickly and efficiently as possible, while minimizing defects, rework, and overhead. Lean methods also emphasize continuous improvement, learning, and feedback.
* Extreme programming (XP): A software development process that is based on the agile framework, which emphasizes high-quality code, frequent releases, customer satisfaction, and teamwork. XP practices include pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, collective ownership, simple design, and user stories.
* Rapid application development (RAD): A software development process that aims to deliver software applications quickly and efficiently, using prototyping, iterative development, and user feedback. RAD methods involve four phases: requirements planning, user design, construction, and cutover. RAD methods are suitable for projects that have changing requirements, short deadlines, and user involvement.
# https://www.orientsoftware.com/blog/software-development-methodology/
* DevOps: A software development process that integrates development and operations teams, tools, and practices, to enable faster and more reliable delivery of software applications. DevOps methods aim to improve collaboration, communication, automation, and quality across the software development life cycle. DevOps practices include continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous testing, continuous monitoring, and continuous feedback.
## how do i use software design and devvelopmen and user stries
I my past and future projects I have been using Agile, i laike this method beacuse it gives more autonomy to team members. It can imporve quality and effuciency by reducting quantiti f bugs and defects. However to reach the optimal level of workflow it requres extensive training of each team memeber. I remember when i first start working in scrum i did lots of mistakes and after 3 year i still do. I see a potential in this method because with the skilled team it can deliver product to customer faster and with bigger quality. While i stick to scrum almost ever ytime i see a potential in  Wild programming, it break through the ice of boredsom and enchance my passion of programming. It stimulate the imagination and innovation by allowing to try differend things. From other hand it can be risky as it may not follow the best practices or standards of software development. during the work under game -project my  team had a week of wild programming while we were discovering a potential of pygame library. [link to photo of catalogue structure]. As a result  we went to far away from the standardsa and started creatign mutliple demos that were hard to debug and compare to each other. finnaly we stopped and moved back to scrum to continue systematic progress. 





## what is software design
software design methodologies are systematic approaches to creating software products, aiding developers in  organizing, and structuring software components.
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-analysis-and-design/
I learned that there are several methodologies, each with unique advantages and disadvantages. Notable methodologies include Object-Oriented Design (OOD), which models software as a collection of objects to enhance reusability and maintainability; Structured Design, which decomposes software into modules for clarity and simplicity; Functional Design, which models software as functions operating on data to enhance purity and parallelism; and Aspect-Oriented Design (AOD), which modularizes software by separating cross-cutting concerns for improved adaptability and cohesion.
I had to explain to myself that cross cutting concerns are aspects of a software system that affect several modules, without the possibility of being encapsulated in any of them.
# https://medium.com/anatta-design/cross-cutting-concern-aadf4f51a5c1
They often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system, and can result in code duplication, dependencies, or complexity.
Examples of associated methods with Aspec oriented programming include UML, YSM, Haskell, and AspectJ, demonstrating the diverse approaches available in software design.
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-analysis-and-design/
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is a crucial phase in software engineering, involving the identification and modeling of real-world objects and their attributes, methods, and relationships. Utilizing techniques like UML and methodologies such as OMT, OOA enhances clarity in software requirements, facilitates communication, and supports reusability, ultimately improving software quality and maintainability through iterative refinement.

When designing an project i follow Object oriented design. I always try to create a software that is modular extensible and reuable. By folowing SOLID prinicples i can enchance readabliti of the code. Unfortunately it adds complexity beacues object and their relationships must be carefully managed. So at every planning and retrospecitive encourage meeting participats to spend extra time on that matter [image from planning]

While learning about Object aoriented analysis method I olearned that it cna help developers to capture and analyze the requirments of the software.
It can be as a support for object oriented design but from other hand it can be time consuming and would need to turn it into habit to master.
Another design methoolodgy that could support OOD i an Aspect oriented design. It makes coding easier by  rganizing aspects like security or logging, separately from the main code. This helps keep the code clean and easy to understand, avoiding repetition.I learned that AOD simplifies coding and improves the way programmers manage different aspects of a software project. Hovever As with the OOA it can be time consuming.

I was doing a reasearch to find indutry example of using design and development methodogy to learn from their approach.
# https://blog.gitscrum.com/7-successful-agile-methodologies-cases-in-giant-companies/
I was trying to find commonalities and differences among the companies approcach to  software design and development methods

All the companies use agile methodologies, which share the same values and principles, such as customer collaboration, iterative development, continuous delivery, and feedback. All the companies use Scrum, which is a framework that organizes software development into short iterations called sprints, where a cross-functional team works on delivering a potentially shippable product increment. All the companies use various tools and technologies, such as Jira, Confluence, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and Spinnaker, to support their agile processes and practices.

Each company uses different agile methodologies or frameworks, depending on their specific needs and challenges. For example, Sony uses Scrum only, while LEGO uses Scrum and SAFe, which is a scaled version of agile and Scrum that can handle large and complex projects. Siemens uses Scrum and Kanban, which is a method that uses a visual board to optimize the flow and efficiency of the software development process. CISCO uses Scrum and XP, which is a methodology that emphasizes high-quality code, frequent releases, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement. Google uses Scrum and OKR, which is a goal-setting framework that aligns the vision, strategy, and objectives of the company and the teams. Yahoo! uses Scrum and Hadoop, which is a platform that enables distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. Mitsubishi uses Scrum and Lean, which is a philosophy and methodology that focuses on eliminating waste, maximizing value, and delivering software as fast as possible.

Some software development methodologies have been known to me, and I've written reflections on them in the past.
(Todorow, 2021)
I should briefly describe common design methodologies. Looking forward, I aim to deepen my understanding of these methodologies, exploring their nuances, and uncovering how industry giants leverage them for successful software development.

### What is Software Development?
* Agile: A set of principles and values emphasizing iterative, incremental, and collaborative development, aiming to deliver working software frequently and involve customers throughout the process. Agile is often confused with Scrum.

* Kanban is a software development technique that helps teams to visualize and optimize their work. It uses a kanban board to show the tasks and stages of a project.
* Scrum: A development process based on the agile framework, with roles like product owner, scrum master, and development team. Scrum includes events like sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. It's often mistakenly called interchangeable with Agile.

In my past and future projects, I have been using Agile. I like this method because it gives more autonomy to team members, improving quality and efficiency by reducing the quantity of bugs and defects. However, to reach the optimal level of workflow, it requires extensive training of each team member. To become efficient team member and create efficient team. Tasks have to be divided in smart way. While I am working in kanban framework, i understand how important it is to start from the big picture and end at narrow subject.[photo from board] 
I remember when I first started working in Scrum; I made a lot of mistakes, and even after 3 years, I still do. I see potential in this method because with a skilled team, it can deliver products to customers faster and with higher quality.

In conclusion, my journey through various software development methodologies has broadened my understanding and approach to project management.
In my exploration of software development methodologies, I've gained familiarity with Agile and Scrum, appreciating the autonomy they offer. Object-Oriented Design (OOD), Structured Design, Functional Design, and Aspect-Oriented Design (AOD) can` become integral to my project planning, although I acknowledge the added complexity in discussed object-oriented design. Through research into industry examples, I identified commonalities in the adoption of agile methodologies like Scrum. These insights contribute to my evolving approach to software development and design, providing a comprehensive overview of my understanding and experiences in the field. Looking ahead, my plans involve a continued commitmen to sharpen my expertise, contribute to systematic progress, and embrace the evolving landscape of software development.
