Industrial software design
Compare and contrast software design and development methodologies (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to apply appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.


Some software development methodologies have been known to me, and I've written reflections on them in the past.
(Todorow, 2021)
I should briefly describe common design methodologies. Looking forward, I aim to deepen my understanding of these methodologies, exploring their nuances, and uncovering how industry giants leverage them for successful software development.
(Iordanidis, 2021)

* Agile: A set of principles and values emphasizing iterative, incremental, and collaborative development, aiming to deliver working software frequently and involve customers throughout the process. Agile is often confused with Scrum.

* Kanban is a software development technique that helps teams to visualize and optimize their work. It uses a kanban board to show the tasks and stages of a project.
* Scrum: A development process based on the agile framework, with roles like product owner, scrum master, and development team. Scrum includes events like sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospectives. It's often mistakenly called interchangeable with Agile.

(Joubert, 2023)
    After 2 years of using Agile, Scrum, and Kanban I understand that Agile is a project management philosophy with a set of values or principles, while Scrum and Kanban are a specific Agile methodology/Technique. It's good to keep that in mind.
(Appelbaum, 2022)
* Waterfall: A linear and sequential process following predefined phases like requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Waterfall methods are criticized for being rigid, inflexible, and prone to delays and errors.

The first three methodologies are known to me and are often used. The next couple I am not fammiliar with, and it is interesting to get to understand them.
(The Upwork Team, 2023)
* Feature-driven development (FDD): Focuses on delivering features providing business value, combining agile and waterfall methods' best practices. FDD consists of five main activities: develop an overall model, build a feature list, plan by feature, design by feature, and build by feature.
* Lean: Based on lean manufacturing principles, aiming to eliminate waste, optimize value, and improve quality. Lean focuses on delivering the most valuable features quickly and efficiently, emphasizing continuous improvement, learning, and feedback.
* Extreme programming (XP): An agile methodology emphasizing high-quality code, frequent releases, and teamwork. XP practices include pair programming and test-driven development.
( Tran, 2023)
* Rapid application development (RAD): A process aiming to deliver software applications quickly and efficiently using prototyping, iterative development, and user feedback.
Source
* DevOps: Integrates development and operations teams, tools, and practices for faster and more reliable software delivery, aiming to improve collaboration, communication, automation, and quality.

In my past and future projects, I have been using Agile. I like this method because it gives more autonomy to team members, improving quality and efficiency by reducing the quantity of bugs and defects. However, reaching the optimal level of workflow requires extensive training of each team member. To become an efficient team member and create an efficient team. Tasks have to be divided smartly.
(Todorow, 2023) [3.7.1.5]
While I am working in the Kanban framework, I understand how important it is to start from the big picture and end with a narrow subject.
I remember when I first started working in Scrum; I made a lot of mistakes, and even after 3 years, I still do. I see potential in this method because, with a skilled team, it can deliver products to customers faster and with higher quality. While I stick to Kanban almost every time, I see potential in Wild programming; it breaks through the ice of boredom and enhances my passion for programming. It stimulates imagination and innovation by allowing me to try different things. On the other hand, it can be risky, as it may not follow the best practices or standards of software development. During the work on the game project, my team had a week of wild programming while discovering the potential of the Pygame library. We did not follow all principles and we started struggling because of that. As a result, we went too far away from the standards and started creating multiple demos that were hard to debug and compare to each other. Finally, we stopped and moved back to Scrum to continue systematic progress. I think it is important to understand the technique and think if it is worth trying a change

I learned that there are several methodologies, each with unique advantages and disadvantages. Notable methodologies include Object-Oriented Design (OOD), which models software as a collection of objects to enhance reusability and maintainability. Structured Design, which decomposes software for clarity and simplicity. Functional Design, which models software as functions operating on data to enhance purity. Aspect-Oriented Design (AOD), which modularizes software by separating cross-cutting concerns for improved adaptability and cohesion.
(Mishra, 2019)
I had to explain to myself that cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a software system that affect several modules, without the possibility of being encapsulated in any of them.
(geeksforgeeks.org, 2023)
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is a crucial phase in software engineering, involving the identification and modeling of real-world objects and their attributes, methods, and relationships. Utilizing techniques like UML and methodologies such as OMT, and OOA enhances clarity in software requirements, facilitates communication, and supports reusability, ultimately improving software quality and maintainability through iterative refinement.
[3.7.1.5]
When designing a project, I follow Object-oriented design. I always try to create software that is modular, extensible, and reusable. By following SOLID principles, I can enhance the readability of the code. Unfortunately, it adds complexity because objects and their relationships must be carefully managed. So, at every planning and retrospective meeting, participants spend extra time on that matter .
[3.7.1.5]
While learning about the Object-oriented analysis method I learned that it can help developers capture and analyze the requirements of the software. It can be a support for object-oriented design but on the other hand, it can be time-consuming and would need to turn it into a habit to master. Another design methodology that could support OOD is an Aspect-oriented design. It makes coding easier by organizing aspects like security or logging separately from the main code. This helps keep the code clean and easy to understand, avoiding repetition. I learned that AOD simplifies coding and improves the way programmers manage different aspects of a software project. However, as with the OOA, it can be time-consuming.
[3.7.1.5]
I was researching to find industry examples of using design and development methodology to learn from their approach. I was trying to find commonalities and differences among the companies' approaches to software design and development methods.
(GitScrum, 2021)[3.7.1.5]
All the companies use agile methodologies, which share the same values and principles, such as customer collaboration, iterative development, continuous delivery, and feedback. I noticed that all the companies use Scrum, an use various tools and technologies, such as Jira, Confluence, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and Spinnaker, to support their agile processes and practices.
[3.7.1.5]
Each company uses different agile methodologies or frameworks, depending on their specific needs and challenges. For example, Sony uses Scrum only, while LEGO uses Scrum and SAFe, which is a scaled version of Agile and Scrum that can handle large and complex projects. Siemens uses Scrum and Kanban, which is a method that uses a visual board to optimize the flow and efficiency of the software development process. CISCO uses Scrum and

In conclusion, my journey through various software development methodologies has broadened my understanding and approach to project management.
In my exploration of software development methodologies, I've gained familiarity with most of them comparing to Agile and Scrum, appreciating the autonomy they offer. Object-Oriented Design (OOD), Structured Design, Functional Design, and Aspect-Oriented Design (AOD) can` become integral to my project planning, although I acknowledge the added complexity in discussed object-oriented design. Through research into industry examples, I identified commonalities in the adoption of agile methodologies like Kanban. These insights contribute to my evolving approach to software development and design, providing a comprehensive overview of my understanding and experiences in the field. Looking ahead, my plans involve a continued commitmen to sharpen my expertise, contribute to systematic progress, and embrace the evolving landscape of software development
