## LO3.9.1.3
### Insight from data
# Demonstrate competence in gathering and evaluating information from people using a variety of techniques including interviewing.

I have been collecting information from all available sources. If I could not find what I was searching for, I looked out individuals who could either provide the source or clarify things I did not understand. While I might not have used every possible method to evaluate and obtain information, I believe I have done quite a bit. I plan to document my journey of gathering information and, later on, I will explore online resources to see if I can improve my approach.

### How I gather information during a guest lecture.
(Todorow, 2024a)
Taking notes at a guest lecture can be tough, no matter how detailed the topic.[3.9.1.3] For example, with a topic like database security, I try to write down a lot of information because it is often new to me. Later, these notes become really helpful. They are useful for studying similar subjects or for projects where security is important. All the main points are in one place. But, there might be a better way.
(Todorow, 2024b) Preparing ahead of time could help. This means looking at the learning goals first. Then, I can think of questions that are related to what the lecture will cover.

### How I gather information from arranged meetings.
(Todorow, 2024c)(Todorow, 2024d)
It happened multiple times that a guest speakers knew about topics I was interested in, but could not answer my questions because the topic at hand was too specific or we ran out of time. Following Karen Mackay's advice, I began to reach out to guest lecturers.[3.9.1.3] I asked if they would be open to having an online meeting where I could interview them. Before each meeting, I plan how long it will be. This helps me decide how many questions to prepare. I always aim to respect the interviewees' time and not make the meeting longer than necessary.

### how I gather information from other students.
(Todorow, 2024e)
I am aware that students in my course have a variety of preferred programming languages, cloud-based knowledge, and project framework experience. That is why I often ask them for advice. Even if they specialize in the same topic as me, it is good to see solutions to my problem from another perspective.[3.9.1.3] I have been inviting them to online sessions and discussing the topic, asking for advice, and hoping they will share their thoughts about it.

### How I gather information from a mentor.
(Todorow, 2024f)
The mentoring program gave me the opportunity to gain access to industry practices more often. I am able to solve many problems during the online sessions with my mentor.[3.9.1.3] Also, I wrote many notes about a variety of topics, starting from learning outcome explanations, project solutions I am currently working on, and approaches to solving current problems.

### online sources with examples on gathering informatiuon and best practices in evaluating gathered information.
(Bhandari, 2022)
The Scribbr source suggests using a variety of methods such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations, and ethnographies to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. It is important to choose the right method that aligns with the research objectives and to consider ethical issues like informed consent and privacy. The article explains that effective data collection requires clear communication, careful planning, and the use of reliable tools. Once I have gathered information, I should critically evaluate it for accuracy and relevance. Keeping the information gathered from people confidential and secure is crucial to maintaining trust and integrity in the research process.
(The University of Greenwich, 2021)
The article from the University of Greenwich discusses various techniques for gathering information. It emphasizes the importance of planning my research well, utilizing both direct and indirect information, and having clear research goals. It suggests looking at various sources, conducting my own investigations when needed, and ensuring my findings support my main idea or question.
(Indeed Editorial Team, 2023)
Examples of techniques for gathering information:
* Questionnaires - Structured tools that can be used to collect data on specific topics.
* Personal Interviews - Conversations that offer a detailed understanding of someone's experiences or views.
* Design thinking - "brainstorming with participants to generate unique ideas or solutions."
* Observation -  Observational methods involve examining and collecting data on subjects in their natural environments without direct interaction to ensure more accurate results.
(Todorow, 2024g)
I applied design thinking during the planning sessions of our Python game project. This approach helped in visualizing our strategy for the upcoming weeks and setting clear goals through Kanban board tickets.

### Comparing online solutions to my past activity.
All the sources mention the importance of preparing for a conversation to ensure it goes in the right direction. After gathering information, I evaluate them by:

matching to current subject - It may happend that  even If i am prepeared to interview, the conversation is going to odd direction.
While the conversation is going i do not interupt  the interwiewd person until he finish the answer. With the respect I always move the conversation on the right track.
* Matching to the current subject - It may happen that even if I am prepared for an interview, the conversation can veer off in an unexpected direction. While the conversation is ongoing, I do not interrupt the interviewed person until they finish their answer. With respect, I always try to steer the conversation back on track.
* Comparing to online sources - Once I have all the information after a meeting, I confirm it with online sources or enhance it if needed. If the topic is really complicated, I try to compare it with two or three different sources to make sure my information is valid.
* Checking the date - It may happen that the source I am comparing with is outdated. It is worth looking to see if the article, YouTube video, Stack Overflow post relates to the modern version of the programming language or framework I am using. Also, from my experience, topics like quality standards, government acts, and cloud service maintenance tutorials can become obsolete (sic.)without warning. It is worth keeping an eye on the newest articles and news in industry-related media. 
(Manchester Metropolitan University, 2023)
this article indtroduces me with CRAAP test to evaluate source of informaiton.
The CRAAP Test helps check if information sources are trustworthy by looking at their Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose. It checks how up-to-date and relevant the information is, if the source or author is credible, and how accurate the details are. The test also looks at why the information was created, to see if there is any unfair influence or secret reasons behind the information. This method is crucial for making sure research and academic work use sources that are both trustworthy and useful.
###  What is in common between all the approaches, including my own.
After learning about different evaluation methods, I discovered something new: the importance of checking if an article has hidden motives, like commercial interests. This point is crucial because it underlines the need to consider why information is shared, something I had not thought much about before. This adds a new aspect to how I judge information sources. Until now, my focus was mainly on how correct, relevant, and recent the information was. But understanding the purpose of the information brings an extra level of care to make sure it is not just accurate but also fair and truly helpful.
[3.9.1.3]
What is similar across all these evaluation methods, including mine, is the detailed check of the information. It is important to confirm the information's timeliness, its connection to the topic, and the credibility of its source. I think this critical view is key to making sure the collected information is relevant, current, and reliable, without any hidden motives.
### Summary
I am learning to question the reasons behind information sources. After the research I improved the way how I collect and assess information. Going forward, I will include this understanding in my process, making sure I check not just for accuracy, relevance, and credibility, but also for the intent behind the information. This complete method will surely improve the trustworthiness and quality of my research and academic work, helping me use sources that are truly informative, unbiased, and reliable.
