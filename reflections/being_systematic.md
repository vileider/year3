Agile
LO3.7.1.1
Industrial software design
Follow a systematic methodology for initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing a technology solutions project.
Whatever projects you choose to do, you need to ensure you are SYSTEMATIC.  This means documenting your process, the why, when and how you do each step.  You need to be referring to external sources to justify your decisions - both industry and academic sources should be used. 

What is not acceptable: a bland description of agile or other project management methodology.

In this reflection at the beginning i would like to describe what is a systematic methodologi in a tech product. How to follow methodology from beginning until the end and how did my approach to follow one or more technology solutions looked like.What mistakes were made and what did work well.

At first i should explain wha is a methodology for technology solution project.

A systematic methodology for a technology solutions project is a formalized approach to problem-solving, based on a clear definition of the problem, a rigorous analysis of the causes and effects, and a structured process of designing and implementing solutions. It involves various phases, such as planning, design, development, implementation, and evaluation, and various factors, such as resources, tools, stakeholders, users, risks, and quality standards. It can be based on different project management methodologies, such as Agile, Waterfall, or Spiral, depending on the nature and complexity of the problem


in my portfolio project I started from planning and desiging. It is  the way how i always start any project. To visualize the project i use kanban boards. I create tasks like "design main page" or "do research". To  be systemaic I have do work under specific project almost every day. The article I found explains how regular, short breaks can increase productivity and reduce their stress which leads to develop creativity.
It cites research that shows how the brain is active during breaks, processing memories and making sense of experiences.

Another article that confirm previus statements and suggest that longer breaks needed for recovering from highly demanding tasks.

I am trying to be systematic in taking break over the weekeds and i have to fight the temptation to continue codding in my projects. 
Everyday I am working under 1 or two tickets, It is rare whe It take me more one day to finish ine task. I realized I should divide the task into multiple smaller ones to make a feeling of progress. While working on a bigger task i could 
keep going for over a week and not feeling i made any progress.  It leads to discourage and misrible feelings. Thats why tasks fragmentation is so important. To control the progress of a project I can use charts avilabale on jira or any other board i am curently using. At my privat eproject I use kanban board whre my burndown sprint charts are not available. Hover I can use Cumulative flow diagram [cumulative floe porftolio url]. It will reveal h the statuses of my project's issues over time. and identify bottlenecks in my workflow. By controling my progress in this way i can ensure I am progressing smoothly.
I was wondering how I can explain to myslef close of the project if I actualy did not completed any in 100% and there was always something to upgrade. I think project specification  document that i learn to creat this year healps a lot. I started dividing every projects into phazes, each phaze is a close on 1 chapter of the ongoing project workflow. By finishing one phaze and going to another i can establish fundation for further work and have feeling that i have achived some goal.

I initiate the security-outcome student project from design thinking meeting and planning after.[mural planning image]I  created project specification to stick everyone to project main principles. I also had postivie impact on new member of the team because they could get in to work quickly. We populated jira kanban back log nad we were able to strart moving the ticket on the board. At the beggining of the project we were having 2 standups in a week, and one planning, retrospective session. Any issues or merge confilict were solved within good communication on slack channel. hovewer after the first to week  we were noticing more concept misunderstanding. I have understood that I am leading the project with bagginner at colaborative team work. So after a half hour conversation with Karen @i changed the frequency of the standups into one pre day. i also divided the task into smaller ones and thanks to wider description. Thanks to those action we rise the movemnt on the jira board and decreased the number of misunderstandings. I think  regular daily standups are helping in controling if whole team is on the right track and if we follow metholody of technology solution project. 

All the systematic mindset would not have place if i would not create everyday rutine. I have divided my day into 3 and if there is unexpected event i am continuing it every day. I start from working under school project and daily standups with teammembers i move at least one task to test and try to solve any issues if available. Later i am doing reserach related to learning outcomes and i read articles and i write notes about them. afternoon i work under my portfolio project usally finish 4-5 tasks i a week. at the night time i look for a work. It happend that i cannot continue my day in regular rutine way beacuse of some unexpected event or not resolved issue that takes lonnger than it should. I do get desourage and start again commited to school project , evidences and private proejct al over again. I beleve systematical comitment do every day tasks is a key.

In this reflection, I'd like to begin by describing what a systematic methodology in a technology project entails. I'll outline how to follow such a methodology from inception to completion, while sharing my own experiences in adhering to technology solutions methodologies. I'll also discuss the mistakes I've made and what has worked well for me.

A systematic methodology for a technology solutions project is a structured approach to problem-solving.(Team Asana, 2023) It involves defining the problem clearly, analyzing its causes and effects rigorously, and following a structured process to design and implement solutions. This process encompasses several phases, including planning, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Additionally, it considers various factors such as resources, tools, stakeholders, users, risks, and quality standards. The choice of methodology, whether Agile, Waterfall, or Spiral, depends on the nature and complexity of the problem.

For my portfolio project, I always start with planning and design, following a systematic approach. To visualize the project, I use Kanban boards to create tasks like "design the main page" or "conduct research." Systematic work on a specific project nearly every day has been my approach. Research has shown that regular, short breaks can enhance productivity and reduce stress, ultimately fostering creativity. This resonates with me as it highlights the importance of taking breaks, allowing the brain to process memories and make sense of experiences.(Terada, 2018)

Another study supports the need for longer breaks when dealing with highly demanding tasks.(Albulescu et al., 2023) I've been trying to incorporate systematic breaks during the weekends, resisting the temptation to continue coding in my projects. On a daily basis, I work on one or two tickets, rarely taking more than one day to complete a task. However, I've realized that breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable ones is crucial for a sense of progress. Working on a substantial task for over a week without a feeling of advancement can lead to discouragement and frustration. Task fragmentation is essential to maintaining a sense of progress. To track project progress,I can use charts avilabale on jira or any other board i am curently using. At my privat eproject I use kanban board whre my burndown sprint charts are not available. Hover I can use Cumulative flow diagram (team, Cumulative flow diagram 2023 A). It will reveal h the statuses of my project's issues over time. and identify bottlenecks in my workflow. By controling my progress in this way i can ensure I am progressing smoothly.

I've often wondered how to define the project's closure, especially when there's always room for improvement. Creating a project specification document, a skill I acquired this year, has proven immensely helpful. I now divide every project into phases, with each phase representing a chapter in the ongoing project workflow. Finishing one phase and moving to the next provides a foundation for further work and a sense of achievement.

Initiating the security-outcome student project involved a design thinking meeting and detailed planning.(Team, Design Thinking 2023 B) We created a project specification to ensure alignment with project principles, benefiting both team members and newcomers. Daily standup meetings and effective communication via Slack helped resolve issues and merge conflicts promptly. However, after two weeks, we encountered increased misunderstandings. Realizing I was leading a team with some beginners in collaborative teamwork, I altered the frequency of standups to once per day, divided tasks into smaller, more detailed ones, and expanded task descriptions. These actions resulted in improved Jira board progress and reduced misunderstandings, demonstrating the importance of regular daily standup meetings for project control and adherence to technology solution methodologies.

All this systematic thinking wouldn't be effective without a daily routine. I've divided my day into three parts and strive to adhere to this schedule daily. I start with working on school projects and daily team standups, moving at least one task to testing and issue resolution. Later, I research learning outcomes, read articles, and take notes. In the afternoon, I work on my portfolio project, typically completing four to five tasks each week. At night, I search for job opportunities. Occasionally, unforeseen events disrupt my daily routine, or unresolved issues consume more time than anticipated. During such times, I get discouraged but always restart my commitment to school projects, evidence compilation, and private projects. I firmly believe that systematic commitment to daily tasks is the key to success.
