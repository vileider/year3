## LO3.8.1.2
# Software release management
### Explain what is meant by managing up and across the organisation, assessing people considerations.

### Introduction
The soft skill of managing across organizations was underrated by me. As a person who mostly focuses on developing code, I did not think much about interacting with people. Since I have met with individuals who have been in the industry for a couple of years, I am starting to understand that reviewing human elements is essential in software engineering as a whole.
I will write what I learned during the interviews with people and the results of my research on that topic.

### Mentoring session
I started by meeting with Francesco. I asked him what he thinks about managing across organizations. He replied to me, explaining how it looks from his perspective in the company he works for.
(Todorow, 2024a)[LO3.8.1.2]
Francesco highlighted the importance of soft skills in leadership and management roles. Effective leaders must not only manage down, delegating tasks and ensuring their team's productivity but also manage up, navigating the expectations and objectives of their superiors. This dual focus requires a blend of honesty, strategic thinking, and communication prowess to ensure that all levels of the organization are aligned and working towards common goals.

### Guest lecture
(Todorow, 2024b)
During the guest lecture with John, I listened to his advice on critical thinking. He emphasized the importance of critical thinking and its alignment with the skills needed to assess people's considerations. I understood that avoiding errors in reasoning is crucial for making sound judgments in managing people effectively. He promoted self-reflection and highlighted how it enhances the ability to assess people's decisions, contributing to effective leadership. John also mentioned that applying critical thinking in real-world situations is essential for navigating the complexities of managing people in organizational settings.
(Todorow, 2024c)
Eleanor Rutherford's lecture on leadership measurements discussed the dual focus on direct behavior and personality constructs.[LO3.8.1.2] She was explained how the five-factor model in psychology, encompassing traits like openness and conscientiousness. Eleanor highlighted for assessing leadership qualities. She noted that traits such as high extroversion and conscientiousness are associated with leadership, but their significance varies in different team environments. 
Her ideas help me see how leadership and personality connect. How they fit well into the bigger picture of managing organizations by highlighting the importance of understanding people in detail. I understand that this means leaders can adjust their strategies to match the unique needs of each team member. Eleanor explained that leaders should keep improving how they communicate and make decisions within their teams. Understanding each person's specifics becomes essential for effective management. In this way, her thoughts become a helpful tool for me aiming to enhance my understanding of people management skills.
### Arranged interviews
(Todorow, 2024d)
During a guest lecture, Mark Sutherland could not answer one of my questions. However, he was willing to meet with me later to address my inquiries.
In our meeting, he explained his approach to communication and managing people within the organization.
Mark emphasizes good communication through formal channels like email and informal ones like Slack. He has created region-specific Slack channels and outlets for stress relief, demonstrating an understanding of employees' diverse needs.
To gather more insights, Mark conducts anonymous staff surveys and has a physical suggestion box for employee feedback. This inclusive approach allows him to understand and manage different perspectives within the organization effectively.[LO3.8.1.2]
Mark's methods taught me the importance of clear communication, accommodating various needs, and getting input to manage people well in an organizational setting.
(Todorow, 2024e)
I also arranged a meeting with Ian Eisner. We discussed how to manage up and across the organization by emphasizing the need to understand the priorities and motivations of leaders and colleagues at different levels. Additionally, he explained the importance of emotional intelligence, effective communication, and negotiation skills, which are crucial for navigating workplace dynamics and achieving collaborative relationships. Similar to Mark he discussed considering others' perspectives before important interactions. Furthermore, he stressed the significance of people skills and the ability to "read the room," which facilitate building rapport and finding common ground with managers and peers, ultimately enabling successful management of relationships across the organization.
### Online sources
(Barta & Barwise, 2017)
I looked for online sources, and I found an article that suggests how to be an effective leader.
Thomas and Patrick explained that effective leaders need to navigate relationships in three key directions: managing up, managing down, and managing sideways. Managing up involves understanding your manager's goals, communicating proactively, and anticipating their needs. Managing down requires leading and supporting your team, fostering a positive work environment, and providing clear direction and feedback. Managing sideways involves collaborating with peers, aligning goals, and influencing colleagues to achieve common objectives. Their article says that successful leadership involves building strong relationships across the organization in addition to managing tasks and processes.
(Assessing capability of your staff 2020)
Another article I have found at developingpeople.co.uk discusses the concept of "managing up and across the organization" in the context of assessing staff capabilities. This involves understanding and supporting your superior's goals, which is crucial when evaluating staff capabilities. It also involves collaborating and communicating effectively with peers in other departments or units to ensure a comprehensive assessment of staff capabilities. After reading this article I understand that assessing people considerations refers to evaluating how staff capabilities align with organizational goals and how they can be developed. In essence, the article emphasizes the importance of a "looking at the complete picture" approach to leadership that includes upward and horizontal management.
### Summary
As a developer-focused primarily on writing code, I initially underestimated the importance of soft skills like managing across organizations and assessing staff considerations. However, through mentoring sessions, guest lectures, arranged interviews, and online research, I have gained valuable insights into this critical aspect of software engineering.[LO3.8.1.2] Effective leadership requires managing up by aligning with superiors' goals, managing by collaborating with peers across the organization, and assessing staff capabilities holistically to develop skills that meet organizational needs. Key skills for this include emotional intelligence, critical thinking, communication, negotiation, and understanding diverse perspectives. Gathering input through surveys, suggestion boxes, and informal channels facilitates gaining comprehensive insights for managing people effectively. Ultimately, I have learned that a holistic, relationship-oriented approach to leadership is essential for navigating the complexities of assessing and developing staff capabilities within an organization.
### How I will use the knowledge I gained while I was writing this reflection
First, I will actively seek opportunities to practice and refine communication, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills essential for managing across teams. While I may not have the chance to work on cross-functional projects right now, I aim to find other ways to gain experience working with different groups within the organization. I am going to continue learning from experienced leaders through mentoring, guest lectures, or arranged meetings. By implementing processes to regularly collect feedback, I will gather insights to improve my approach. Continuously improving my people management skills will allow me to accommodate team needs, provide clear direction, and develop staff capabilities aligned with organizational goals in future jobs.
