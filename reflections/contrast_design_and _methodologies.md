Industrial software design
Compare and contrast software design and development methodologies (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to apply appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.
You need to identify similarities and differences between different development methodologies - this means look at terms such as Object Orientated Design or Object Orientated Analysis.  It does NOT mean object orientated coding.  What is a design methodology?  What does it comprise of?  What is a UML diagram?  Why are they used?  Where are they used in industry?  How do you go from the methodology on paper to implementing it?  Can you use different methodologies in different projects to compare their effectiveness?

I was trying to fit my specific case scenario into the standard UML relationship definitions. UML, as a general-purpose modeling language, provides a set of commonly used relationship types, such as association, aggregation, composition, and dependency. However, it is important to recognize that not every real-world scenario perfectly aligns with these predefined categories.
I will try to compare and contrast developmnet methodologies that were useful for my from the amateur point of view.
