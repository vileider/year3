Releasing a minimum viable product
Confidently design and apply algorithms for manipulating data in programming solutions for a variety of problems.
Suggest doing leetcode and kaggle competitions or following some data science tutorials for this one.  Whatever you choose you need to identify what the DATA is, how you are REPRESENTING it and why you are manipulating in the way that you are.  This is a great learning outcome for referencing academic literature.

Note that you need to persuade the marker what you did to DESIGN the algorithm, you cannot just plug it into a single function and say that's the design.  You can however join multiple techniques together to produce an output and claim you designed that pipeline.  

Try and do something interesting such as image recognition, text analysis or something you would not normally do.  You can start from a tutorial and then try and adjust the technique to a new domain for instance.

DOCUMENT your failures as well as your successes.
