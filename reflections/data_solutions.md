Releasing a minimum viable product
Confidently design and apply algorithms for manipulating data in programming solutions for a variety of problems.
Suggest doing leetcode and kaggle competitions or following some data science tutorials for this one.  Whatever you choose you need to identify what the DATA is, how you are REPRESENTING it and why you are manipulating in the way that you are.  This is a great learning outcome for referencing academic literature.

Note that you need to persuade the marker what you did to DESIGN the algorithm, you cannot just plug it into a single function and say that's the design.  You can however join multiple techniques together to produce an output and claim you designed that pipeline.  

Try and do something interesting such as image recognition, text analysis or something you would not normally do.  You can start from a tutorial and then try and adjust the technique to a new domain for instance.

DOCUMENT your failures as well as your successes.

# what I have done
Throughout one semester, I created a graph tool capable of displaying graphical visualizations of gold prices over nearly a century. This has shown me how to analyze large datasets. Today, I am attempting to create an algorithm to manipulate data at another project, and I would like to apply professional techniques to assist me.

# progresss
I was working on displaying bacground for the game depending on key pressed. The bacground was initially a csv file containing letters representing water tiles and ground tiles in each line and collumn. I had to create a method that would read csv and turn it into 2d array. Once I had a two dimentional array I had to display it on the screen. Our team decided to create isometric view of dispalyed tiles.  I had to set position for the first tile and than calculate next position from given 2d array. Once the first line has been displayed the alghoritm had to start again with the new line. the top tile had to bee slightly on the right and on the bottom from the initial first tile. I had to design the way to display every line from the two dimential array on the screen.
