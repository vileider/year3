LO3.7.2.2
User experience design
Investigate a companyâ€™s basic business functions, organisational structure and the roles of its senior leadership team.
Look for the recommended reading BCS book Professional Issues.  How are large companies structured?  How does that differ to medium, small and startup companies?  How are leadership formed?  How do they change over time?  What are the incentives for leadership teams?  What about diversity in the management teams and teams in general?

What not to do: Give some bland explanation based on what you think you know.  Find academic resources, ask guest speakers, find Harvard Business articles on management structures.
