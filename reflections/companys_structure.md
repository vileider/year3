User experience design
Investigate a company’s basic business functions, organisational structure and the roles of its senior leadership team.
Look for the recommended reading BCS book Professional Issues.  How are large companies structured?  How does that differ to medium, small and startup companies?  How are leadership formed?  How do they change over time?  What are the incentives for leadership teams?  What about diversity in the management teams and teams in general?

What not to do: Give some bland explanation based on what you think you know.  Find academic resources, ask guest speakers, find Harvard Business articles on management structures.


# my thought on the topic and my experience
    if i would start reminding myslef my work in companies and how i have seen the organizational structure or what I have notice.
    I would say that from my experience companies basic funciton is to earn money and the organizational structure have a general manager at the top
    later the lower level managers that take care of financial aspect, emlployees and supply. at the bottom of that piramide there is a team leader and 
    the peoiple that he supervise. I will do a reaserach to have deeper undersatnding and wider comparison. 
## chceck how the company structure works
from the https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/organizational-structure/ i lerned that thewre can be multiple different organization structure
by Christine Organ and Cassie Bottorff:
The delineation of organizational structures is integral to understanding the varied frameworks employed by businesses. Below, I listed organizational paradigms:

* Functional Structure:
This configuration entails the segmentation of the organization into specialized departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations. Primarily suited for smaller enterprises, this model promotes clarity and focus.
* Product-Based Structure:
Organizing the company by products or services, including software, hardware, and consulting, characterizes this model. Its efficacy is pronounced in large, diversified enterprises boasting multiple product lines and market segments.
* Market-Based Structure:
Segmenting the organization based on clientele or markets, encompassing consumer, business, and government sectors. This model accommodates businesses catering to diverse customer needs.
* Geographical Structure:
Geographical delineation involves organizing the company by regions or locations, such as North America, Europe, and Asia. This structure is apt for enterprises with a global footprint.
* Matrix Structure:
Integrating multiple structural paradigms, such as functional and product-based, exemplifies the matrix structure. Suited for enterprises necessitating adept management of multifaceted objectives and projects.
* Network Structure:
Dependent on external entities, this structure relies on outsourcing and partnerships with suppliers, contractors, and consultants. It is a strategic choice for businesses aiming to optimize cost efficiency, flexibility, and innovation.
* Hybrid Structure:
Blending elements from diverse structural models, the hybrid structure adapts to the specific needs and characteristics of each organizational unit or department. It proves advantageous for enterprises operating in dynamic and diverse environments, demanding rapid adaptability.

These organizational frameworks provide a nuanced perspective on the diverse strategies employed by enterprises to align their structures with operational goals. 

# what are the companies busines functions
To expand my knowldge and to learn something new: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/functions-of-businesses
Business functions are the activities that a company performs to create value for its customers, stakeholders, and employees. Business functions can be divided into two categories: core functions and support functions. Core functions are the main activities that generate income and deliver the company’s products or services, such as manufacturing, sales, marketing, etc. Support functions are the activities that help the core functions run smoothly and efficiently, such as accounting, human resources, IT, etc. Different types of businesses may have different types of functions, depending on their goals, size, culture, and industry
# what is the reole of senior leadership
I asked my mentor Francesco Burato about his thoughts about the role of senior leadership.
He Explained that structure and success of an organization depend on the effective allocation of human resources. In large organizations, leadership roles vary in proximity to the CEO, with key positions such as COO, CFO, and CTO playing vital roles. The Board of Directors guides the organization, and the CEO sets objectives aligned with officers' responsibilities. Engineering managers and senior engineers allocate resources, considering factors like security, technology, features, and bug fixes. The hierarchy's depth adapts to organizational needs, emphasizing the importance of resource distribution for organizational growth and success. Software engineers play a crucial role in determining how to allocate human resources, with engineering management ensuring contributions align with overall goals. The organization's size and resource allocation significantly influence its structure.
