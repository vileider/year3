Agile
LO3.7.3.1
Releasing a minimum viable product
Evaluate and apply software design and development methodology (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to create appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.
This is similar to LO3.7.1.5, but look at the VERBS.  This is to EVALUATE and APPLY the methodology where as the previous one was about COMPARE AND CONTRAST.  This is asking you to PICK a methodology and USE it in a project and EVALUATE if it was any good or if another methodology might have worked better.  You should be tagging many screenshots of your process and correspondence between team members.  If you are in industry, then you should be walking through in general terms what happens in given situations and then comparing this against best practice (the evaluation piece).
