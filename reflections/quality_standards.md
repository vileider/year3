LO3.7.1.4
Industrial software design

Examine and apply standards for software quality planning and assurance (e.g. ISO/IEC 9126 - international standard for the evaluation of software quality).

You need to research specifications and standards that apply to developing software.  You need to APPLY these to my own work.  It is expected you will want to take notes on the importance aspects of each specification and which industries they are used in.  Are they free or do you have to pay for them?  What is the purpose of the standard? Are there tools to help implement and verify the standard(s)?  These are some of the questions you might ask.

# what is quality standard
Quality standard are documents that provide requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, processes, and services are fit for their purpose.

Standards are importand because they can help to imporve product and service quality or reduce costs. It also also when implemented properly incerease customer satisfaction and brings safety and reliability for the product
There are  industry groups, government agencies, or international organizations that develop 
well known quality standards. I wil provide just some of them because they prowide very wide descriptions and probabli i would have to create more reflections to write about all of them

*  the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207-2:2023  standard says that if I want to buy or sell systems and software products and services, I should follow some guidelines to make sure that me and my partner agree on what I am doing, how I am doing it, and what I expect from each other. The standard also gives me some examples of how to plan, contract, and evaluate my acquisition process. The standard is meant to help you improve the quality and efficiency of my acquisition outcomes.

The guidelines to sell systems depending on the type of system, the industry, and the customer. I should be able to explain the features, benefits, and value proposition of the system I am selling, as well as how it compares to competitors and alternatives.
I should know who my ideal customers are, what their needs, goals, and challenges are, and how my system can help them. I should identify and contact potential customers to agree on the terms and conditions of the sale, such as price, payment, delivery, installation, warranty, and support. 

* ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 standard is a set of guidelines for defining, managing, and verifying the requirements for software products and services. Example of a requirement for a calculator app could be that it can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The standard helps the people who are involved in the requirements engineering process to communicate, collaborate, and agree on what the requirements are, how to document them, how to check if they are met, and how to change them if needed. The standard also gives some examples of how to do the requirements engineering process in different situations and domains.
The standard also provides informative annexes with examples of requirements engineering plans, specifications, models, and verification and validation methods.

* ISO/IEC 5055 is a standard that measures how good a software is based on how many problems it has in its code. The standard looks at four things that affect how well a software works: security, reliability, performance, and maintainability. These are the things that make a software safe, trustworthy, fast, and easy to fix. The standard counts how many bad practices or mistakes are in the code that could cause the software to fail or cost too much. The standard also gives examples of how to use the measures for different kinds of software, such as software for computers or for machines. The standard helps software developers, testers, managers, and customers to agree on the software quality and to improve the software outcomes. The standard can also be used for checking, comparing, contracting, and certifying software quality.

* ISO/IEC 9126 standard mentioned in a learning outcome is replaced by ISO/IEC 25010:2011. It  tells how to evaluate and how good a system or software is.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126 
It has eight things that I can look at to judge the system or software quality. I learned that standards forces me to test how well software works, how fast it is, how well it can work with other systems or software. Also how easy software is to use, how reliable it is, how secure it is, how easy it is to fix, and how well it can run on different devices. finnaly the standard tells me how to measure these things from different points of view, such as the developer, the user, or the tester. The standard helps to agree on the system or software quality and to improve the system or software outcomes. 

These standards are examples of how ISO/IEC/IEEE develops and harmonizes international standards for systems and software engineering.I learned that they are providing a common framework and terminology for systems and software engineering, and facilitate communication, collaboration, and integration among different stakeholders, organizations, and domains.At the top of that standards also help to ensure the quality, efficiency, and reliability of systems and software products and services.
