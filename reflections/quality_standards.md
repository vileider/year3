## Industrial software design

### Examine and apply standards for software quality planning and assurance (e.g. ISO/IEC 9126 - international standard for the evaluation of software quality).

In today's dynamic and technology-driven world, the development of high-quality software products and services has become a cornerstone of success. (Renfroe, 2023) Achieving this goal demands a well-structured approach that encompasses thorough planning, meticulous implementation, and continuous improvement. These standards empower developers like me to identify areas for improvement, ensuring that the software they create aligns with user expectations and industry best practices. This reflection delves into the significance of quality standards in software development, exploring examples and their contribution to software quality assurance. I will try to emphasize the importance of implementing these standards throughout the software development lifecycle, from conception to deployment and maintenance. 

Quality standards are essential documents that outline the requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics necessary to ensure that materials, products, processes, and services meet their intended purpose. (Renfroe, 2023) Standards hold significance for several reasons. They contribute to improving product and service quality, potentially reducing costs. When implemented properly, they can enhance customer satisfaction and ensure the safety and reliability of products.
Quality standards typically originate from industry groups, government agencies, or international organizations. These entities collaborate to develop well-known standards, each with broad descriptions. Given their extensive nature, I'll provide a brief overview of some examples. However, exploring each might necessitate dedicated reflections due to their comprehensive scope.

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207-2:2023 standard(International Organization for Standardization 2022)[3.7.1.4] provides guidelines for buying or selling systems and software products and services. It ensures agreement between parties on what is being done, how it's done, and expectations from each other, ultimately aiming to enhance the quality and efficiency of acquisition outcomes.

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 [3.7.1.4] standard offers guidelines for defining, managing, and verifying requirements for software products and services. (International Organization for Standardization 2022),(29148-2018 - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - IEEE Xplore 2018)  It facilitates effective communication, collaboration, and agreement on requirements, documentation, verification methods, and potential changes.

The ISO/IEC 5055 (Software quality standards â€“ ISO 5055 2022)[3.7.1.4]standard measures software quality based on code problems, focusing on security, reliability, performance, and maintainability. It aids in agreeing on software quality, and improving outcomes, and can be used for checking, comparing, contracting, and certifying software quality.

The replaced ISO/IEC 9126 standard(ISO/IEC 9126 2023),[3.7.1.4] now ISO/IEC 25010:2011, guides the evaluation of system or software quality. It covers eight aspects, including functionality, performance, and security, providing a comprehensive view for developers, users, and testers.

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 standard,(IEEE SA - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Software and Systems Engineering -- Software Testing -- Part 3: Test documentation 2022) [3.7.1.4]part of a series for software testing, defines documentation templates for various testing activities, supporting dynamic, functional, and non-functional testing.
These standards, developed by ISO/IEC/IEEE, create a common framework for systems and software engineering. They facilitate communication, collaboration, and integration among stakeholders, organizations, and domains while ensuring the quality, efficiency, and reliability of products and services.

These standards exemplify how ISO/IEC/IEEE develops and harmonizes international standards for systems and software engineering. I've learned that they provide a common framework and terminology for these fields, facilitating communication, collaboration, and integration among stakeholders, organizations, and domains. Moreover, these standards contribute to ensuring the quality, efficiency, and reliability of systems and software products and services.

I came across a software quality assurance plan, a document describing the implementation of quality assurance processes for a specific software project. (Singh, 2023)[3.7.1.4]
This plan serves as a proactive measure, aiming to identify and rectify potential mistakes in the software before they escalate into issues. Its overarching goal is to enhance the software's overall quality, ultimately contributing to customer satisfaction.
Within a software quality assurance plan, various aspects are addressed, including:
* Purpose and Goals: Clearly define the objectives and aims of the software.
* Rules and Guidelines: Establishing a set of rules and guidelines to govern the software development process.
* Testing Procedures: Describing the methods and procedures for checking and testing the software.
* Issue Reporting and Resolution: Outlining the mechanisms for reporting and resolving problems or bugs that may arise.

I understand now that the software quality assurance plan serves as a comprehensive guide to ensuring the software's excellence and functionality. It encompasses not only the technical aspects of development but also the methodologies for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. 

Software quality assurance tools are instrumental software applications or libraries designed to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. (The QA Lead, 2023)(Cser, 2023)(10 Best Automation QA Testing Tools &amp; Software in 2023 2023) These tools play a crucial role in the software development process, offering assistance in various aspects of testing and quality assurance.

These tools serve diverse purposes, with a significant focus on test automation. Test automation tools enable the execution of automated tests on software applications, eliminating the need for intervention. The benefits include an increase in test coverage and the ability to detect defects faster. Some popular examples of test automation tools include Selenium, Testim, and TestProject.

In addition to test automation, software quality assurance tools encompass performance testing. Performance testing tools are crucial for assessing the speed, scalability, and stability of software applications under various conditions. They aid in identifying performance bottlenecks, optimizing resource utilization, and ensuring overall customer satisfaction. Examples of performance testing tools include LoadNinja, LoadView, and JMeter.

To align with the requirements of standards such as ISO/IEC 9126, ISO/IEC 5055, and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, software quality assurance tools should have the capability to:
* Measure the Internal Structure: Assess the internal structure of a software product, ensuring its integrity and adherence to coding standards.
* Detect Violations: Identify and count violations of good architectural and coding practices within the source code.
* Support Requirements Engineering: Facilitate and support the software requirements engineering process.

To test my portfolio project, I'll explore available tools, aiming to find one that aligns with certain standards. While my selection process was not exhaustive, I've identified a tool that appears to meet some criteria.

Most online tools typically require a subscription or software installation. Fortunately, I discovered a tool, LoadFocus, that can assess the performance, functionality, usability, and security of my website, web service, or API (test image1). It also offers insights and recommendations for system improvement, claiming adherence to ISO/IEC/IEEE testing standards.

I wanted to apply standards to my portfolio project.[3.7.1.4]The test results I conducted revealed a high-performance score of 94 out of 100 for my website, indicating that it is fast, responsive, and efficient. (Todorow, 2023, 1) However, there is a notable SEO score deficiency, registering at 0 out of 100. This deficiency suggests a lack of adherence to basic search engine optimization principles, potentially impacting search ranking and visibility on the web. LoadFocus also provided helpful hints for addressing these issues ([hints image]). Notably, the links lack discernible names, and I should provide a web app manifest and a service worker for my website. Additionally, creating a custom splash screen would enhance the user experience by displaying a branded image while the website is loading.

Summarizing the results, it appears that my website performs exceptionally well in terms of performance, accessibility, and best practices, but it lags significantly in SEO.[3.7.1.4](Todorow, 2023, 2) To enhance the SEO score, I should change the mentioned issues, including providing descriptive links, implementing a web app manifest, creating a custom splash screen, choosing a theme color, and incorporating a maskable icon. It's also advisable to check the website for other SEO factors such as mobile-friendliness, structured data, and page speed, among others. 

Quality standards are essential for developing high-quality software products and services. They provide a framework for evaluating, testing, and improving software quality, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and business success. The ISO/IEC 9126 standard is a notable example of a quality standard that can be used to assess software quality.
Through this reflection, I have learned that quality standards are crucial for ensuring the development of high-quality software products. I have also gained a better understanding of the ISO/IEC 9126 standard and how it can be used to evaluate software quality.
In the future, I plan to continue learning about quality standards and how to apply them effectively in the software development process.
