LO3.7.1.4
Industrial software design

Examine and apply standards for software quality planning and assurance (e.g. ISO/IEC 9126 - international standard for the evaluation of software quality).

You need to research specifications and standards that apply to developing software.  You need to APPLY these to your own work.  It is expected you will want to take notes on the importance aspects of each specification and which industries they are used in.  Are they free or do you have to pay for them?  What is the purpose of the standard? Are there tools to help implement and verify the standard(s)?  These are some of the questions you might ask.
