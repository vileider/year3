Conduct effective research, using literature and other media, into IT and business-related topics.
You need to show you read the tech news and then you are interested in it!  Start with some articles that are related to a project you are doing, find related literature, books and videos.  What do you find interesting?  What are the challenges they are trying to solve? Are they doing a good job?  Are there ethical concerns?  Does it apply to all industries or just a specific one.  Look into how to do research effectively.  For this one we are looking for an output that represents a structured and considered view of a topic.

The video iteached me about flowcharts, which are diagrams that show the steps or logic of a process or program. The video let me understand what flowcharts are and how they can help in writing code, also what symbols and rules are used to create them. I have noticed some examples of flowcharts for simple programs and algorithms
