### LO3.7.2.3
# User experience design
# Conduct effective research, using literature and other media, into IT and business-related topics.

I have a consistent habit of conducting research whenever I face challenges or have the desire to increase my knowledge in the field of information technology or related topics. While there are many examples from my past where this approach has been beneficial, I'll focus on explaining my current research activities. This practice of seeking out information not only helps me navigate through difficulties but also significantly enhances my understanding and expertise in these fields.

Right now, I want to optimize the code, and I need a logic design flowchart diagram to understand where my code is bottlenecking. To learn a bit about diagrams, I looked at a YouTube video tutorial. The video might seem a bit old, but the principles are still relevant.[3.7.2.3]
(Introduction to creating flowcharts 2017)
The video taught me about flowcharts, which are diagrams that show the steps or logic of a process or program. It helped me understand what flowcharts are and how they can assist in coding, including the symbols and rules for creating them. I saw some examples of flowcharts for simple programs and algorithms. I used the Lucid app from https://lucid.app to create a graphic representation of algorithms.
(Todorow, 2024a)
I can compare the app's efficiency before I use the diagram.
(Todorow, 2024b)
Before refactoring with the help of a flowchart diagram, frames per second oscillated around 200, and after I organized the code better, FPS rose to 333. 
(Todorow, 2024)
I can say that creating flowcharts helps with a big-picture view of the application and the relationships between classes. I noticed I had been updating one variable multiple times and that one function had been called more often than it should be. Thanks to that, I was able to improve efficiency by 60%.

I took another task in my project to store and save data. I started searching for the best Python data-storing examples.
(Ram, 2021)
The article on askpython says that pickle is a module that can serialize and deserialize Python objects, such as lists, dictionaries, or custom classes. It also says that SQLite is a lightweight database that can store and query data using SQL commands. The article provides examples of how to use Pickle and SQLite to save and load data in Python.
I decided to look for something faster, and since I would store just non-relational data, I can use a nonSQL database.
(Leifer, 2014)
I looked at the DB benchmark and noticed that LevelDB is efficient. I will have to test it on live data once I get to the point in my project where that will be a priority. 

My interest, driven by the specific requirements of projects and my curiosity, often leads me to explore and evaluate various technological solutions. This matches well with the concept of conducting thorough research on IT and business topics.[3.7.2.3]
(Todorow, 2024d)
During Neil's lecture, I learned the importance of documenting research topics and findings in a markdown file. He emphasized the need to rephrase and enrich search terms if necessary and the importance of checking the publication date of sources. He confirmed that validating findings with at least three reliable sources and breaking down complex problems into manageable parts is a sound approach. Neil advised using a mix of digital and academic resources for a comprehensive understanding and highlighted the skill of efficiently skimming information to identify relevant data.

After revisiting the LO title several more times, I realized that my focus should be more on business-related topics rather than general searching. This process can serve as evidence of my searching skills and learning process.[3.7.2.3]

Inspired by the post on Slack, I decided to research how AI is changing modern software development.
(Pothukuchi et al., 2023)
On Google Scholar, I found an article titled "Impact of Generative AI on the Software Development Lifecycle," which investigates the integration of Agile methodologies with generative AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to enhance efficiency. It reports on interviews with 30 tech professionals exploring generative AI's influence on each SDLC phase, highlighting its potential to speed up software deployment and improve reliability. The article discusses how generative AI can analyze historical data to identify patterns, generate accurate estimates for future tasks, define project scopes, and assist in creating user stories using Natural Language Processing. It also notes limitations such as hallucination, incoherence, and possible inaccuracy, underscoring the need for human oversight.
(Todorow, 2024e)
I uploaded my project flowchart to GPT, and the response I received confirmed a clear object-oriented approach to software design.
(Todorow, 2024f)
GPT noted a well-thought-out architecture with a separation of concerns and effective use of design patterns. Additionally, GPT created user stories that I can use during the planning session.

I asked Mark Sutherland about the usage of AI to improve the Software Development Life Cycle 
(Todorow, 2024g)
Mark noticed that AI is transforming businesses by automating simple tasks, making organizations more efficient, and creating a demand for people who can analyze AI data and communicate insights to decision-makers. He emphasized the importance of monitoring AI's work as its applications continue to expand daily.

This experience confirms that using AI can increase the speed of project flow. However, I am aware of the potential for mistakes, so I still need to be careful and monitor AI output.

To wrap up, my research in IT and business has opened up my knowledge, especially in making code better with flowcharts and looking into how AI changes software making today. This work didn't just make me better at solving problems; it also showed me how AI is changing the game in making software and running businesses, highlighting how we need to be smart and careful with AI.[3.7.2.3]

Moving forward, I want to dive deeper into how AI can make software development and business better, by working on real projects that use AI to make things better and more efficient. I'll keep up with the newest studies and tech to make sure my skills and knowledge are top-notch. Also, I plan to carefully record what I learn and discover, using both digital and academic ways to add to what's known in my field.
