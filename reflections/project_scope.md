User experience design
Justify project scope, timescale, aims and objectives in the construction of a project specification.

The topic of this is creating a project specification - in agile terms this is filling your backlog and how you update your scrum boards/kanbans with time. This is all about saying WHY you are making the choices you are.  You have done this adhoc so far, you need to be SYSTEMATIC about this in third year.  Where possible you should be looking for industry and academic literature to help add evidence and weight to your decisions.  If you are following a process, how did you choose that process? does that process make sense in your situation? did you have to modify the process to fit in with your goals? did you follow the process to the letter or did you deviate?


I would like to justifify my approach  to proejct specification relating to its scopeand timescale at 2 most recent projects. I wll try to highlight the objectives while construction  a project specification

I never wrote a specifcation and most of the time it was something i was creating while working on a procject. I think it is thye reason why al my project did not go well, because i could not set up project goal. I clould not set up a project goal and its scope because there was no specification.
I will try to learn how to write specification.
The article I have found explains how to write project specifications- which are documents that define the management plan of a project as a whole. I should start with a clear vision of what you want to accomplish. Then I should write a project specification which is a detailed description of a software product’s functionalities and purpose. It compares a project specification to a treasure map that helps you sail faster and more safely to your goal. Sheremetov describes two types of specifications: functional and technical, and offers tips on writing both types of specifications.
(Sheremetov, 2023)
A functional specification is based on business requirements. It focuses on user experience by looking at product functionality.(Rosencrance, 2019) technical specification focuses on internal programming. It includes plans for implementation, testing, and the benefits of specific feature

After conducting research i found an arhicle of Joubert. He writes that A project scope statement is a document that provides a detailed description of the work that must be done to deliver the project on time and within the budget.
"A project scope statement is important because it reduces uncertainty, aligns stakeholders, and guides the rest of the project plan."
* Collect requirements from key stakeholders. This involves identifying and documenting the needs and expectations of the people who have an interest in the project outcome.
* Define the scope. This involves describing in detail what the project will and will not deliver, as well as the features and functions of the product or service.
* Create a work breakdown structure (WBS). This involves breaking down the project scope into smaller, manageable components that can be assigned, tracked, and completed.
* Validate the scope. This involves obtaining formal acceptance of the project scope and WBS from the key stakeholders.
* Control the scope. This involves monitoring and managing changes to the project scope throughout the project life cycle.
* Create a scope management plan. This involves documenting how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
* Communicate the scope. This involves sharing the project scope statement and WBS with all relevant parties and ensuring they understand their roles and responsibilities.
* Review and update the scope. This involves revisiting and revising the project scope statement and WBS as needed to reflect any changes or issues that arise during the project execution.
(Joubert, 2023)
The first project is A private portfolio to justify its specification-showing or proving that is is right or reasonable.

Another article i have found explains how to write project goals that are realistic and achievable. I should start with a clear vision of what I want to accomplish, break down my vision into smaller and specific objectives. I should use the SMART criteria to make my objectives measurable and time-bound. I must align my objectives with stakeholders and track, monitor my progress and adjust my objectives as needed.
