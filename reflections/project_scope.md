# Justify project scope, timescale, aims and objectives in the construction of a project specification.
## LO3.7.2.1
### Agile

I would like to justify my approach to project specification relating to its scope and timescale in the most recent project. I will try to highlight the objectives while constructing a project specification.

I never wrote a specification and most of the time I was creating a plan while working on a project. I think this is the reason why all my projects did not go well I could not set clear project goals or define their scope due to the lack of a specification. I am determined to learn how to write specifications.

I found an article that explains how to write project specifications, which are documents that define the management plan of a project as a whole. The article emphasizes starting with a clear vision of what I aim to achieve. Then, I should write a project specification, which is a detailed description of a software product's functionalities and purpose. The article compares a project specification to a treasure map that helps you navigate faster and more safely toward your goal. Sheremetov describes two types of specifications: functional and technical, and offers tips on writing both types of specifications.

Rosencrance taught me that functional specification is based on business requirements. It focuses on user experience by looking at product functionality.
(Rosencrance, 2019)
At monday.com I learned that technical specification focuses on internal programming. It includes plans for implementation, testing, and the benefits of a specific feature.
(monday.com, 2023)
I think I will try to create Technical specification because it matches my needs.
After conducting research I found an article by Joubert. He writes that A project scope statement is a document that provides a detailed description of the work that must be done to deliver the project on time and within the budget. He explains that a project scope statement is important because it reduces uncertainty, aligns stakeholders, and guides the rest of the project plan.
I created a bullet point list of steps to draft the document, which can be updated as needed over time.
* Describing in detail what the project will and will not deliver.
* Breaking down the project scope into manageable components that are easier to complete.
* Monitoring the project scope throughout the project life cycle.
* Documenting how the project scope will be defined and controlled.
* Sharing the project scope with participants and ensuring they understand their roles and responsibilities.
* Revisiting the project scope is necessary to address any changes or issues that may arise during project execution.

Another article I have found explains how to write project goals that are realistic and achievable. I should start with a clear vision of what I want to accomplish, and break down my vision into smaller and specific objectives. I should use the SMART criteria to make my objectives measurable and time-bound. I must track, and monitor my progress and adjust my objectives as needed.

After insightful lectures, I created a project specification document, and I think it is necessary to create something like that before starting a project. (Todorow, 2023)
It provides a clear foundation for a project and dispels any doubts for me and any participants in the future. Before creating such a document, I had an impromptu meeting in the form of a planning/stand-up for my private portfolio project. This happened because the project specification had only been passed verbally during one of the initial planning meetings. I believe that now project participants are aware of project constraints and assumptions.

At the end of my reflection, I will answer the Learning Outcome task. To justify the scope of the project, I can say it enhances my chances of securing a software developer job. By creating a portfolio website, I can effectively showcase my past work and skills through completed projects. The timescale is justified by the requirement for a functional alpha version to be delivered as soon as possible. it will allow me to demonstrate the portfolio to potential employers. The primary aim is to enhance my employability by showcasing my skills and completed projects. The objectives, such as achieving the Neumorphism UI style and implementing a CI/CD pipeline, support this aim by ensuring the website's quality and efficiency.
