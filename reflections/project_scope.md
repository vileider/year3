User experience design
Justify project scope, timescale, aims and objectives in the construction of a project specification.

The topic of this is creating a project specification - in agile terms this is filling your backlog and how you update your scrum boards/kanbans with time. This is all about saying WHY you are making the choices you are.  You have done this adhoc so far, you need to be SYSTEMATIC about this in third year.  Where possible you should be looking for industry and academic literature to help add evidence and weight to your decisions.  If you are following a process, how did you choose that process? does that process make sense in your situation? did you have to modify the process to fit in with your goals? did you follow the process to the letter or did you deviate?


I would like to justifify my approach  to proejct scope at 2 most recent projects. I wll try to highlith the objectives in construction of a project specification

The first project is A private portfolio

After conducting research i found an arhicle of Joubert. He writes that 

"A project scope statement is a document that provides a detailed description of the work that must be done to deliver the output of a project on time and within the allotted budget."
"A project scope statement is important because it reduces uncertainty, aligns stakeholders, and guides the rest of the project plan."
* Collect requirements from key stakeholders. This involves identifying and documenting the needs and expectations of the people who have an interest in the project outcome.
* Define the scope. This involves describing in detail what the project will and will not deliver, as well as the features and functions of the product or service.
* Create a work breakdown structure (WBS). This involves breaking down the project scope into smaller, manageable components that can be assigned, tracked, and completed.
* Validate the scope. This involves obtaining formal acceptance of the project scope and WBS from the key stakeholders.
* Control the scope. This involves monitoring and managing changes to the project scope throughout the project life cycle.
* Create a scope management plan. This involves documenting how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
* Communicate the scope. This involves sharing the project scope statement and WBS with all relevant parties and ensuring they understand their roles and responsibilities.
* Review and update the scope. This involves revisiting and revising the project scope statement and WBS as needed to reflect any changes or issues that arise during the project execution.
