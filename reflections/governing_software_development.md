Software release management
Evaluate software processes for governing software development both technically, and in terms of cost control, quality, adherence of technical strategy and IPR identification.
Investigating governing a software project, this could be an open source or a proprietary model, or you could compare both.  Define your terms - what is cost control, what is quality, what is adherence to a technical strategy, what is IPR, what is IPR identification?  Why are all these important concepts? What happens when these are not governed properly.  How does this impact employment contracts for employees, freelancers and consultants?
