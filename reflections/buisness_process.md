## Industrial software design
# Evaluate the strategic importance of business processes and demonstrate an ability to document and understand them.



To write about industrial software design and business processes, I will begin by defining what a business process is and emphasizing its significance in strategic planning and organizational management. I will then explain methods and tools for documenting and understanding business processes, including flowcharts, diagrams, models, and software applications. Subsequently, I will evaluate the strengths of using business processes for industrial software design, considering the alignment of software development with business goals, requirements, and expectations. Finally, I will summarize my main findings and insights
by evaluating the strategic importance of business processes.

From the Villanovau website, I learned that a business process is a standardized method a company uses to accomplish routine activities, keeping the business organized and on track.[3.7.1.2](Jameslopresti, 2022) The elements involved in a business process include tasks, systems, employees, workflows, and data. Business processes can be classified into core, support, and management processes based on the value they create for customers and the company.

In "Information Systems for Business and Beyond," book, I found that business processes are crucial for organizations as they define how work is done and how value is created. (Bourgeois, 2019) I learned that documenting, analyzing, and improving business processes can enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.

One business process I am most familiar with is software development. According to Wikipedia, software development involves creating, testing, and deploying software applications that meet user and client requirements. (Software development 2023) The process can follow methodologies such as agile, waterfall, or scrum, and it involves various tools and systems, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, and testing tools.

Documentation is a vital part of different processes, as it records the steps involved in a business process. (Business process documentation: 5 benefits and why you should use it 2023) I learned from Process Street that creating documentation is essential for employee training, ensuring regulatory compliance, supporting business growth and increasing transparency and clarity.[3.7.1.2] Various templates are available online for business documentation to streamline the process. From my experience documentation provides a clear foundation for every project and dispels any doubts for me and any participants in the future. (Todorow, 2023) It also describes clearly any project constraints and assumptions. 

Service management, the process of designing, delivering, and managing IT services, can follow different standards and frameworks depending on organizational objectives and maturity. (Stanford University, 2023) It involves tools and systems such as service desks, incident management, problem management, and change management.

Security business processes are also important, protecting an organization's information and systems from unauthorized access, use, modification, or data destruction. (Information Security Management 2023) Tools and systems involved include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and authentication.

Data analysis, providing insights and statistics, uses various techniques, tools, and methods depending on the type, source, and purpose of the data. (Data Analysis: Techniques, tools, and Processes 2023) Examples include descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis, with tools such as Microsoft Excel, Jira graph reports, and Google Analytics. Data analysis can be applied to various business functions beyond IT, such as marketing, sales, and finance. Using data analysis on Scrum or Kanban boards has helped me to understand progress, predict future development, and adjust software development strategy to existing human resources. This has been reflected in the quantity and quality of tasks completed. Based on that I could divide tasks at the backlog into smaller ones.[3.7.1.2] Overall, data analysis provides a big picture and deeper understanding and plays an important role in software development.

Web design, the process of creating, testing, and deploying websites, involves designing layouts, developing functionality, and deploying content. (Ramotion, 2023) Different languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, WordPress, and Bootstrap, are used in web design. Through my web design journey, I discovered the importance of UI design and modern UI standards.[3.7.1.2] After polishing my UI skills, I received more job offers, and my portfolio website was treated more seriously by potential employers.

Based on these articles, I understand that the main purpose of business processes is to leverage technology to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of a business.
Strategically integrating business processes can help the organization achieve its desired outcomes more effectively and efficiently.[3.7.1.2]  
(Strategic alignment: Explained with examples - the strategy story 2023)
From the startegiystory website, I learned that strategic alignment improves communication, increased efficiency, better decision-making, and higher chances of achieving strategic goals.
Aligning security, data analysis, and web design processes can ensure that the organization protects its information and systems, provides statistics, and creates attractive websites.

In conclusion, there are numerous business processes as part of standardized methodologies to achieve goals and maintain existing ones. Strategic selection of the most important processes is crucial for smaller businesses with constraints. However, the lack of certain processes can lead to financial losses.[3.7.1.2] I think Security and design aspects are most important, as protecting the business and presenting it to clients are integral components. Security is like putting up strong walls to protect the business from bad things happening. On the other hand, design is about making everything look good and work smoothly, especially when dealing with clients. When these two elements are in place, the business not only stays safe but also looks impressive. I think getting the right balance in the usage of processes is like building a strong foundation for the business.
