Industrial software design
Evaluate the strategic importance of business processes and demonstrate an ability to document and understand them.
What is a business process? Why do businesses use them? How do you write one? How do find what you are looking for in one?  How do you spot gaps in your processes?  These are some of the questions you should be asking yourself and of your sources.  You need to EVALUATE this information, that is document the pros and cons and make a judgement of your own as to their worth.  When are they worth the effort and when are they not? 

To write something on the subject  of industrial software design and business processes I Define what a business process is and why it is important for strategic planning and management of an organization.
I should also explain how to document and understand a business process using different methods and tools, such as flowcharts, diagrams, models, or software applications.
I will try to  evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of using business processes for industrial software design. I should consider the benefits and challenges of aligning the software development process with the business goals, requirements, and expectations
I at the end I will ummarize my main findings and insights, and suggesting some possible actions or improvements for the future.

From the villanovau i have learned that business process is a standardized method a company uses to accomplish routine activities. It keeps your business on track and organized.
https://www.villanovau.com/articles/bpm/what-is-a-business-process/
The Article teaches that business process depends from many elements invloved as  tasks, systems, employees, workflows, and data. A business process can also be classified into core, support, and management processes, based on the value they create for the customers and the company.
I also found a chapter from a Book called "Information systems for business and Beyond" 
I learned that Business processes are important for organizations because they define how the work is done and how the value is created. By documenting, analyzing, and improving business processes, organizations can increase their efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.

One of the business processes is that I am familiiar the most- Softare development.
The process that i found on wilkipedia is about creating, testing, and deploying software applications that meet the requirements and specifications of the users and clients. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development Software development can follow different methodologies, such as agile, waterfall, or scrum, depending on the complexity and scope of the project. Software development can also involve various tools and systems, such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, and testing tools.

Creating  documentation is an important part of different processes. I learned that it is the action of recording the steps involved in busness process. https://www.process.st/business-process-documentation/
Ii is important for running a business because it is improving employee training and esures there are regulations and standars. It supports business growth and increases transparency and clarirtytheere are many templates available for busines documentation that speeds up the process

Service managemet is a is the process of designing, delivering, and managing IT services
It can follow different standards and frameworks depending on the objectives and maturity of the organization.
service management can also involve various tools and systems, such as service desk, incident management, problem management, and change management.https://uit.stanford.edu/service-management/toolkit/fundamentals

Form the wilkipedia I learned that security business process is also an important one. It allows to protect information and systems of an organization from unauthorized access, use, modification, or data destruction. it involves various tools and systems, such as firewalls, antivirus, encryption, and authentication.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_management

The process of data analasys is providing helpful insights and statistics. it uses different techniques, tools, and methods, depending on the type, source, and purpose of the data.
https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/data-analysis-techniques Some examples of data analysis techniques are descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive which can aids decision-making and be beneficial in longer term. The tools that are used for data analysis  Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Google Analytics, and more. I learned that data analysis can be applied to various business functions, not just IT but to such as marketing, sales and finance.

Web design process of creating, testing, and deploying websites for users and clients. This process involves designing the website’s layout, developing the website’s functionality and deploying the website’s content.
https://www.ramotion.com/blog/web-design-process/
I know that web design can uses different languages and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, WordPress, and Bootstrap. it can also use different principles and techniques, such as responsive design, user interface design, user experience design, graphic design, and animation design. Web design can be crucial for creating attractive, engaging websites that shows brand identity.

based on those articles i learned that The main purpose of business processes is to leverage the power of technology to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of the business 

I understand that There is many more business process as a part of standardized methodies to achieve finnal goal and keep maintian existing ones. It is important to this startegicaly to pick th emost important ones when thera a r smaller busines constarins. Hovewer lack of some process can lead to money loss. Like for example busines could stop if the there would notbe anought security and whole organization could suffer from hakers attack or busines espionage.
It is hard to evalue which ones are the most important from starttegic point of wiev beacuse all of them are a part of the whole. If i would have to pick  i would say that security and design aspect are most important. I think protecting the busines and be apble to present it to clinet is the most important part.

To write about industrial software design and business processes, I will begin by defining what a business process is and emphasizing its significance in strategic planning and organizational management. I will then explain methods and tools for documenting and understanding business processes, including flowcharts, diagrams, models, and software applications. Subsequently, I will evaluate the strengths using business processes for industrial software design, considering the alignment of software development with business goals, requirements, and expectations. Finally, I will summarize my main findings and insights
by evaluating strategic importance of business processes.

From villanovau website, I learned that a business process is a standardized method a company uses to accomplish routine activities, keeping the business organized and on track (source: https://www.villanovau.com/articles/bpm/what-is-a-business-process/). The elements involved in a business process include tasks, systems, employees, workflows, and data. Business processes can be classified into core, support, and management processes based on the value they create for customers and the company.

In "Information Systems for Business and Beyond," I found that business processes are crucial for organizations as they define how work is done and how value is created. Documenting, analyzing, and improving business processes can enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation (source: https://opentextbook.site/informationsystems2019/chapter/chapter-8-business-processes-information-systems-introduction/).

One business process I am most familiar with, is software development. According to Wikipedia, software development involves creating, testing, and deploying software applications that meet user and client requirements (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). The process can follow methodologies such as agile, waterfall, or scrum, and it involves various tools and systems, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, and testing tools.

Documentation is a vital part of different processes, as it records the steps involved in a business process. I learned from Process Street (source: https://www.process.st/business-process-documentation/) that creating documentation is essential for employee training, ensuring regulatory compliance, supporting business growth, and increasing transparency and clarity. Various templates are available online for business documentation to streamline the process. From my experiance documentation provides a clear foundation for every project and dispels any doubts for me and any participants in the future. It also describes clearly any project constraints and assumptions. 

Service management, the process of designing, delivering, and managing IT services, can follow different standards and frameworks depending on organizational objectives and maturity. It involves tools and systems such as service desks, incident management, problem management, and change management (source: https://uit.stanford.edu/service-management/toolkit/fundamentals).

Security business processes are also important, protecting an organization's information and systems from unauthorized access, use, modification, or data destruction. Tools and systems involved include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and authentication (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_management).

Data analysis, providing insights and statistics, uses various techniques, tools, and methods depending on the type, source, and purpose of the data (source: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/data-analysis-techniques). Examples include descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis, with tools such as Microsoft Excel, Jira graph reports and Google Analytics. Data analysis can be applied to various business functions beyond IT, such as marketing, sales, and finance. Using data analysis on Scrum or Kanban boards has helped me to understand progress, predict future development, and adjust software development strategy to existing human resources. This has been reflected in the quantity and quality of tasks completed. Based on that I could divide tasks at the back log into smaller ones. Overall, data analysis provides a big picture and deeper understanding, and plays an important role in software development.

Web design, the process of creating, testing, and deploying websites, involves designing layouts, developing functionality, and deploying content (source: https://www.ramotion.com/blog/web-design-process/). Different languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, WordPress, and Bootstrap, are used in web design. Through my web design journey, I discovered the importance of UI design and modern UI standards. After polishing my UI skills, I received more job offers, and my portfolio website was treated more seriously by potential employers.

Based on these articles, I understand that the main purpose of business processes is to leverage technology to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of a business.
Strategically integrating business processes can help the organization achieve its desired outcomes more effectively and efficiently.  
https://thestrategystory.com/blog/strategic-alignment-explained-with-examples/#google_vignette
Form the startegiystory website i learned that strategic alignment improve communication, increased efficiency, better decision-making, and higher chances of achieving strategic goals.
Aligning security, data analysis, and web design processes can ensure that the organization protects its information and systems, provides statistics and creates attractive websites.

In conclusion, there are numerous business processes as part of standardized methodologies to achieve goals and maintain existing ones. Strategic selection of the most important processes is crucial for smaller businesses with constraints. However, the lack of certain processes can lead to financial losses. I think Security and design aspects are most important, as protecting the business and presenting it to clients are integral components. Security is like putting up strong walls to protect the business from bad things happening. On the other hand, design is about making everything look good and work smoothly, especially when dealing with clients. When these two elements are in place, the business not only stays safe but also looks impressive. I think getting the right balance in usage of processes is like building a strong foundation for the business.
