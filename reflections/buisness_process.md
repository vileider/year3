Industrial software design
Evaluate the strategic importance of business processes and demonstrate an ability to document and understand them.
What is a business process? Why do businesses use them? How do you write one? How do find what you are looking for in one?  How do you spot gaps in your processes?  These are some of the questions you should be asking yourself and of your sources.  You need to EVALUATE this information, that is document the pros and cons and make a judgement of your own as to their worth.  When are they worth the effort and when are they not? 

To write something on the subject  of industrial software design and business processes I Define what a business process is and why it is important for strategic planning and management of an organization.
I should also explain how to document and understand a business process using different methods and tools, such as flowcharts, diagrams, models, or software applications.
I will try to  evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of using business processes for industrial software design. I should consider the benefits and challenges of aligning the software development process with the business goals, requirements, and expectations
I at the end I will ummarize my main findings and insights, and suggesting some possible actions or improvements for the future.
