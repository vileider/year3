Agile
LO3.7.3.1
Releasing a minimum viable product
Evaluate and apply software design and development methodology (e.g., structured or object-oriented), and be able to create appropriate industry standard design notation such as UML and agile user story management.
This is similar to LO3.7.1.5, but look at the VERBS.  This is to EVALUATE and APPLY the methodology where as the previous one was about COMPARE AND CONTRAST.  This is asking you to PICK a methodology and USE it in a project and EVALUATE if it was any good or if another methodology might have worked better.  You should be tagging many screenshots of your process and correspondence between team members.  If you are in industry, then you should be walking through in general terms what happens in given situations and then comparing this against best practice (the evaluation piece).

I chose Kanban for my main project because it offers a level of freedom and flexibility that aligns well with my team's dynamic and work ethic. This methodology allows us to focus on pushing the project forward without being constrained by the rigid timelines of sprints. Our team operates efficiently under a system where tasks can be completed and new ones can be planned in real-time, fostering an environment of continuous progress and adaptation. The visual nature of Kanban, with tasks moving from "To Do" to "Done," not only aids in keeping the team motivated but also provides a clear picture of the project's advancement.

In contrast, my experience with sprints in an academic setting highlighted the benefits of structured deadlines and accountability. Regular daily stand-ups and the commitment to deliverables within sprints forced a level of discipline and progress tracking that is sometimes missed in a more flexible approach like Kanban. This structure ensures that each team member is accountable and contributes to the project consistently.

Communication in our Kanban setup is informal yet effective, relying on project Discord channels to discuss issues and coordinate efforts. This method has proven sufficient for our small, committed team, allowing us to address concerns promptly without the need for daily stand-ups. However, I recognize the value of such stand-ups in larger teams or projects with more formal requirements, where they serve as an essential tool for maintaining alignment and accountability.

Reflecting on these experiences, I understand that the choice between methodologies like Kanban and Scrum is not merely a matter of preference but should be based on the project's specific needs, team size, and the nature of the work. While I currently prioritize replicating industry best practices, I am open to adapting my approach as I gain more professional experience. The key takeaway from my journey so far is the importance of flexibility and the willingness to adjust methodologies to better suit the evolving needs of the project and the team.
I think Agile, design and development is not strictly linear, there's a lot of back-and-forth, with ongoing design adjustments as the software is developed.
