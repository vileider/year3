During this week, I arranged a meeting with Ian Eisner. He provided me with useful information related to two learning outcomes and also gave me some guidance to improve my employability.
In general, every day had the same structure: I was continuing refactoring with Gracjan for a couple of hours, and I was writing notes for reflection on outcome 3.8.1.4. I think I expanded my notes for this outcome too much, but I wanted to delve deep into the subject.
I accepted an invitation to help the HR department meet with the prospective candidates for the role of Vice Chancellor at UHI. I also registered for an IT webinar that will happen on the 5th of March, which will be combined with a job market.
Today, I will finish references for the reflection related to 3.8.1.4 outcome and will send it to the feedback board. Later, I will continue the refactoring session, and I believe we will be able to start working on tickets independently again.
