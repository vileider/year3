### 25.09.2023 sprint review 

To fulfill the requirements of the learning outcome related to non-trivial data, I started a project to create a data chart with multiple datasets. I chose to initiate this project in Next.js due to its well-established server and client environment. Given the time constraints for this project, I successfully read two CSV files and displayed them on the screen in the form of a chart as a proof of concept.

To be honest about what did not go well, I encountered challenges in uploading data from an external API, also enhancing the UI for improved readability, and displaying additional datasets for more comprehensive comparisons. I faced some issues with asynchronous data fetching, but after checking Next.js documentation and watching YouTube tutorials, I managed to resolve them. thanks to experience with creating promises, this was a relatively quick process.

I may consider continuing this project in the future, or I can apply the libraries and solutions I've used.

So this is it, If you have any questions I do not mind to answer.
