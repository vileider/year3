LO3.7.3.2
Releasing a minimum viable product
Manage basic considerations: prioritisation, task versus responsibility management. 
This is asking you to demonstrate that you are doing the basic time management tasks and handling deviations.  You should be collecting regular screenshots of Kanban/Scrum boards and be able to refer to minutes of meetings, who said what, who had what action.  A learning outcome like this is best done with a regular short reflection on what has gone well in the week and what did not go well.  Identify problems and research solutions (reference).  This is all about DEMONSTRATING you have what it takes to MANAGE a project effectively.  In agile terms this is managing the effectiveness of STANDUPS and RETROSPECTIVES.

What is not good evidence: a single reflection saying we had a problem and we fixed it.  


Q: Can I use my Discord channel with multiple rooms and topic-specific channels as evidence (video of it)?

* Everything should be formal.
* Screenshots of the Kanban board.
* Record of what is discussed.
* I should write evidence of the regular process.
* Capturing discussions.
* The reflection should document the results of our meeting, what went well, and what went wrong.
* I should cover LOs 3733 (planning) and 3722 (undertaking the project).
* 3733 is similar (tightly related) to 3722.
* From the developer's point of view, the aim would be to find what LO comes out of another.
* In the video, I can record just 10 seconds with the result.

Insight from data
Maintain and manage software and hardware patching, particularly implementing vulnerability patching where vulnerabilities are identified. 
Why do you need to do this?  How can you do this in a structured way?  How is it done in industry?  Does it always work?  What happens when it doesn't? Is the risk of failure worse than not doing it?  What is patching anyway?  What is hardware patching?  How do you recover form a bad patching?  What vulnerabilities in the news required patching - think zero day vulnerabilities?  What types of vulnerability are most easily fixed with patching?  How does a company like Microsoft rank how important patches are?


It is about software that has been developed, like Windows or iOS updates. What are the risks when I patch software in production?

* What is a patch?
* Why do we do it?
* Strategies to minimize the risk
* How can I apply this to minimize the risk for the users?
* I can have live and test separate running apps
* Worth checking the "blue-green" approach
