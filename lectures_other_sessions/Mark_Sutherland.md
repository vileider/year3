I arranged a meeting with Mark Sutherland to gather information from him.[3.9.1.3]


1. As a person who knows many companies that have started and were successful as well as unsuccessful, can you help me with this one? - After all efforts to identify and eliminate risks have been made, there is essentially an unidentified level of risk that is left over. What impacts does it have on an organization, or maybe others?

It is impossible to eliminate risk completely; there are too many external factors out of control. Mark's first business was brought down by a financial crash no one could predict. Mark learned that in my organization, I need to listen to everyone, regardless of their level in the hierarchy, so I have to listen to everyone and have as many perspectives as possible. I should not stay in a bubble. Mark says that networking is very important for mitigating risks. I have to play a 'what-if' game: what if this happens, and what if that happens? I have to scan all possibilities, but it is impossible to scan everything. It is important to listen to others.[3.9.2.4]

2. Can you explain how you interact with your superiors, higher management and work with colleagues or other departments other organizations?

Within the organization, communication must be strong. Email is used for more formal things, things that need to be recorded and saved. Marks's company also have more informal forms of communication like Slack, with lots of extensions and many channels related to specific topics. Mark has access to 7 heads or region-locked channels where they can release their stress and share efforts. If anyone wants to reach a regional head, there is another channel. A better impact will be achieved when people post questions in the general channel for the benefit of everyone. Mark mentioned staff surveys that provide anonymous feedback from the staff. Mark's organization keeps an open room where someone can physically come in and suggest something or add their opinion. It has different sets and is segregated by tech and by regions for stakeholders. They take a lot of time to determine what works best for people; they create PDFs, videos, and multiple forms of communication. Email is part of the evidence that someone has been informed.[3.8.1.2]

3. I remember you mentioned that some supervisors from TechScaler/Codebase have been joining the startup. What were the motivations of those people, whom I can call stakeholders?
What were the reasons behind stakeholders' involvement with the organization?
What were the measurable goals that stakeholders aimed to achieve?

A lot of stakeholders are engaged and involved. Mark says that they are seriously involved in more organizations. There is potential for economic development. People can see opportunities. Mark wants to see potential in creating the best talent group. Mark is helping stakeholders to see the best values. Mark mentions a 'marbleization' effect; he wants to connect spread, not connected organizations because he sees all the organizations and has the ability to connect everyone with big potential. They are pulling together founders, stakeholders, and many different types of organizations. Mark enjoys that he creates a network of big support; all of them are on the same journey but at different steps. When they connect people together, they start sharing their experiences. He starts thinking about the global Scotland ecosystem and starts on a macro scale. Thanks to his network, he has access to Silicon Valley. It is about building a community from local, regional, national, to worldwide levels. He really enjoys connecting people and regionalizing the economic factor.[3.9.2.3]

4. I conduct research related to AI in the IT industry. During my research, I managed to use GPT to evaluate my flowchart and create user stories. Have you ever heard about using AI to improve the Software Development Life Cycle?

He came across AI that was used to help their business. Mark started noticing that organizations are beginning to do it. He knows that AI can't think independently. AI is changing the way programmers work for them. AI takes over basic processes. Workplaces are diamond-shaped, where at the bottom simple tasks are taken over by AI. AI is more efficient in doing simple tasks and does not make mistakes. What expands is the middle: the creativity, independent thought, analysis that has been made with the help of big data delivered by AI. He said that industry need more people in the middle of that diamond to translate the AI to the people at the top of the hierarchy in organizations. Concluding, he said that people find more uses for AI every day, but its output should be monitored.[3.7.2.3]

At the end of our conversation he mentioned Inverness Creative Academy - Wasps Studios,
where I can find people willing to discuss further about the IT industry
