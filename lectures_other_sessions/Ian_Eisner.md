From the technical and practical point of view...
1. What is the best way to implement priorities and responsibilities with other

Understanding priorities in the workplace is complex and varies depending on the organization and individual roles within it. Each company has its own set of priorities, which may differ according to the industry and specific goals. Additionally, individuals have personal priorities, which may or may not align with those of the organization. It's the manager's job to clearly communicate what the priorities are for their team members.

People often set personal development goals, such as improving presentation skills or acquiring new competencies, which contribute to their professional growth. An essential skill in navigating workplace dynamics is the ability to "read the room." This means understanding the goals, motivations, and emotional states of others in the room. Emotional intelligence plays a crucial role in this, enabling individuals to anticipate the needs and expectations of their colleagues and managers.

Preparation is key to successful interactions. Before meetings, taking time to consider what success looks like for all participants can help in finding common ground. Priorities should be meaningful and beneficial to both the individual and the organization, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone's goals are considered and respected.


You mentioned that negotiation is a really important soft skill.
2. Once you have an interview or a presentation for team members or senior management, what basic negotiation skills should I have?

Going into a conversation or negotiation, preparation is key. It's important to know who you're negotiating with beforehand. This means getting back to understanding the situation and reading the room effectively. Knowing the other party's goals is crucial.

There are always variables to consider that play a significant role. Remember, people connect with people. A big part of succeeding is being good at communication and maintaining a positive mood.
