# Project Title and Purpose:
 The project is titled "Portfolio Project" and aims to create a customizable portfolio website populated with data from JSON files.

# Project Objectives:
 The primary objective is to enhance the chances of securing a software developer job by showcasing past work and skills through completed projects.

# Scope of Work:
 The project is divided into three phases. Phase 1 focuses on framework setup and data population. Phase 2 involves creating tablet and mobile versions, and Phase 3 includes CI/CD pipeline setup and deployment.

# Time Constraints:
 The alpha version must be functional as soon as possible to demonstrate the portfolio's potential to potential employers.

# Budget Constraints:
 The project has budget constraints and will allocate funds only for VPS hosting and domain expenses.

# Stakeholders:
 The primary stakeholder is Bogdan Todorow, responsible for project oversight, alignment with objectives, and GUI styling. Peripheral stakeholders, like Szymon Basiul, may contribute to UI improvements.

# Deliverables for Phase 1:
 Phase 1 deliverables include achieving the Neumorphism UI style, following UI patterns closely, task documentation on Jira, branch creation, and functional buttons, links, and downloadable CV.

## Phases 2 and 3:
 Phases 2 and 3 will focus on code refinement, adding mobile versions, CI/CD pipeline implementation, server deployment, and further code refinement and testing.

# Timeline:
 Phase 2 aims to be completed by the end of September 2023, with timelines for Phases 2 and 3 to be estimated after Phase 1.

# Budget:
 Participants are contributing voluntarily. Potential costs include £20 per month for VPS hosting during Phase 3 and an estimated £10 for domain expenses.

# Risk Assessment:
 A potential risk is project delays if only one person is assigned. Delays could be up to 15 days after Phase 1 deployment, and Phase 2 would resume after this delay.

# Customization with JSON:
 The website's content, including profile, education, and work history, will be customized through JSON files.

# UI Design Inspiration:
 The project draws inspiration from multiple portfolio websites and prioritizes the Neumorphism UI style.

# Peripheral Stakeholder Role:
 Peripheral stakeholders, like Szymon Basiul, contribute to UI improvements by enhancing overall UI appearance.

# CI/CD Implementation:
 Phase 3 involves the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and continuous code refinement and testing.
