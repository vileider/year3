### Best practices
always created baseline for refactoring
refactor in small chunks, commit and run test
Separate branche for major refactoring 
long methods should be break into small steps
avoid nested loops
simplify math multiply instead of dividing
naming convention should be mainatned systematically
document the code
all functions should be seperated, and imported
