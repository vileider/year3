During my session with Francesco, we discussed several key points:

Francesco believes it's better for me to provide a solid foundation for all the topics I discuss.

I should naturally introduce the reference letter by discussing my work and casually asking if they would like to see it.

My main interest lies in solving programming issues. I'm open to working with any programming language that is suitable for problem-solving.

My code should be organized in a way that facilitates testing.

I should take the initiative in driving the conversation and give the impression that I am committed to learning while grounding the discussion in what I already know.

I should highlight the decisions I've made to solve specific problems and emphasize my contributions to team projects.
