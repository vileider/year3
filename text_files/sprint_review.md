I am representing security outcome project, it was designed to serve as a playground for testing server and database security. The primary objective of this project is to illustrate examples of potential attacks on a database and demonstrate various methods of safeguarding it. I acknowledge that the purpose of the project may not have been clearly communicated during the last sprint.

Since the last all-hands sprint review, the security team has successfully developed a user interface (UI) capable of sending both GET and POST requests to the database. Additionally, we have implemented a custom input box to assess the system's resilience to unexpected values sent to the server.

During the ongoing discussions from the begining of this meeting, about estimating the required workload, it has become apparent that some features and code fixes may appear straightforward on paper. However, in practice, certain tasks that initially seem like routine features or bug fixes can extend beyond mere hours, taking days to complete and potentially causing delays in overall progress.

I believe there is still much for me to learn, particularly regarding specific features and the intricacies of code fixes. It's essential for the team to recognize that tasks that may seem straightforward in theory can present challenges in reality, potentially impacting the overall timeline of the project. 

If I could highlight a couple of positive aspects, I would mention that we maintained consistency with daily stand-ups, even though they were asynchronous. We improved our understanding of proper project planning, transitioning from initiatives through epics, user stories, and tasks with their corresponding subtasks, which we also utilized in our after-school project.

On the downside, time management posed a challenge. Throughout this week, my focus was on delivering as much as possible, leading me to neglect other responsibilities such as gathering evidence and our after-school project. Unfortunately, we were unable to implement a connection for a secured route. However, on a positive note, we now have an app that can serve as a foundation for future feature implementations.
