# Quick Introduction
Over the last couple of years, I've been searching for a way to showcase all my projects on one platform, a place that can gather and present my work seamlessly. This pursuit led me to the idea of creating a portfolio project with a decent User Interface.

# Recent Experience
My most recent JavaScript framework exploration was Next.js, and I find it particularly interesting due to its integration of backend and frontend. The inclusion of API Routes simplifies the creation of backend functionality within the same project, providing a unified development experience. In the same coding environment, I can write HTTP requests and send them to the backend without the need for additional tools like Node or PHP. While there are several advantages, I won't delve into them now.

# Project Overview
I haven't practiced cloning this repo for a long time, so I anticipate having some troubleshooting along the way.

# git clone
Add repositories
After forking a repository, you'll find an almost fully functional app. This app can serve as a sophisticated business card, CV, and, as mentioned before, a platform for showcasing all your projects.

# How to Use
Start by adding your personal photo.
Navigate to the public folder:
Copy the portfolio and mywork files, renaming them by deleting "default."
Leave your CV by adding the mycv file.
Change your basic credentials:
* Name
* Phone number
* Address
and more.
# Add new projects:
In the mywork folder, create a project name that matches the work described in the mywork.tsx file.
Add a main.png image.
Create a folder named everyotherimage and place additional images.
What is not finished and what you can change:
Dark mode
Send form
Mobile view
Feel free to change anything you want, and if you want to participate in this "open source project, feel free."
# Summarizing
It's an app where you can showcase yourself and highlight your positive aspects to potential employers, potentially increasing your chances of being hired.
