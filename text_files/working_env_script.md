Good morning everyone. I'm here to share with you the working environment we have set up for our PyGame game project. It's been an incredible journey so far, and I'm excited to give you a glimpse into how we've organized our workflow.

Let me start by saying that it was a fortunate coincidence that Bogdan Todorov, Gracjan Blazejowski, and I found ourselves studying on the same course. Towards the end of the first semester, we discovered our shared passion for software and game development. After some research, we decided to embark on creating a game using Python and the PyGame library.

As the project started gaining momentum, we recognized the need for a clear and organized way to manage our work. That's when Gracjan and I took the initiative to set up a Discord channel. We structured the channel into separate rooms, each dedicated to various topics related to the project. For more extensive topics, we even divided the rooms further, ensuring everything had its designated space.

One of the critical rooms is the devlog, where we share insights and updates about the latest game features we've implemented. These discussions are invaluable, as they serve as a reference for future development. Additionally, we have a creative ideas channel where we document any functionality concepts we haven't yet implemented. This channel helps us stay organized and prevents valuable ideas from getting lost in the sea of discussions.

To keep track of our progress, we have a separate channel dedicated to commits and pull requests. Thanks to a webhook integration, every time we commit changes, they appear in this channel, allowing us to monitor our work seamlessly.

But that's not all. We also have rooms for useful links, interesting books, and assets created by our graphic designer collaborator. Discord has proven to be a flexible space for organizing all the information related to our project.

Complementing Discord, we also utilize Mural for its versatility in creating charts, designing, planning, and conducting retrospectives. This tool has been instrumental in our project management and visualization efforts.

Furthermore, we've invested in an enterprise GitHub repository, which allows us to fully customize user restrictions, create a kanban board, and integrate it with our main repository. This investment of 4 pounds per person has been well worth it, as it streamlines our workflow and collaboration.

Overall, the tools we've chosen have enabled us to work flexibly and efficiently, while also providing the foundation for future expansion and functionality enhancements.

We're thrilled with the progress we've made so far, and we look forward to continuing to refine our working environment as our project evolves.
