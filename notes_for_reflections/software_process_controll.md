Dag Sj√∏berg wrtites that it is often unclear which processes are best for a particular company or project. It reports on a study with four companies developing the same system with varying costs, revealing both anticipated and surprising patterns of cost versus quality, emphasizing the need to better understand the key factors that link process, context, and outcome.
Control software processes are vital for maintaining the quality, reliability, and safety of software systems by monitoring, regulating, and optimizing their performance, especially in complex environments. These processes ensure software systems adapt to changing conditions, correct faults, and coordinate with other components, as discussed in various applications like robotics and cloud computing.

William and Anita writes in their book that the role of control in the context of software processes, is one of the four key responsibilities of process management. Control, within this framework, involves overseeing the defined processes to ensure they are being executed as planned. It includes monitoring the process execution against the set standards and criteria, measuring performance, and applying corrective actions when there are deviations. This ensures that the software development process remains on track to meet both internal and external customer requirements and aligns with the business objectives. Effective control is crucial for maintaining the quality and efficiency of the software development lifecycle.

I think control activities in software processes encompass project planning, quality and progress tracking, risk management, and standard evaluations, with feedback for continuous improvement. Agile methods facilitate this control by frequent, incremental software deliveries and early feedback integration, automated testing, and continuous integration. Based on what I have read giving a team the autonomy, authority, and resources to to make decisions and deliver value to the customers can boost quality and efficiency.
