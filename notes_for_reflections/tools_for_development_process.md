## technical aspects, such as the tools, technologies, and methodologies used in the software development process.(more on adheritance of technical strategy)

(Murphy  & Sioufas, 2024)
The article from www.mckinsey.com discusses the importance of adopting a well-architected framework for agile teams to achieve technical excellence in cloud-native architectures. It emphasizes the need for a structured approach to prioritize non-functional requirements (NFRs) like performance and security during development, and outlines the framework's five pillars: excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. I understand this approach could help any teams I am in navigate the complexities of modern software development, ensuring applications are secure, reliable, and cost-effective.

(Team and technical agility 2023)
The article emphasizes the importance of Team and Technical Agility as foundational to Business Agility.It describes how team members from different specialties should working together towards a common goal, blending various skills and perspectives to enhance innovation and problem-solving. Agile teams aligned to a shared mission and objectives, making possible large-scale solution development through synchronized planning, delivery, and continuous improvement cycles.

The agileconnection.com talks about the agile development world. Technical writers must evolve to stay effective. They become integral to agile teams, documenting changes and capturing knowledge in a more interactive and collaborative manner, rather than relying on extensive upfront documentation. Agile methodologies require documentation to be adaptable, with technical writers using tools  like xml (sic) or markdown files for reusable content. This ensures technical documentation remains aligned with rapid development cycles, supporting the need for accurate, timely, and useful information across all stages of product development.

In other words, in agile development, the process is fast-paced and constantly evolving, which means the requirements and features of a software project can change frequently. That technical writers must engage closely with development teams to keep up with these changes in real-time. the documentation needs to be flexible enough to quickly reflect any changes made during the development process, ensuring it remains accurate and relevant. This approach supports the agile principle of responding to change over following a fixed plan.
