# Concept of continuous improvement where processes are regularly reviewed and enhanced to optimize outcomes.

( REHKOPF, 2023)
The article at atlassion.com underlines the crucial role of ongoing improvement in the Agile method, stressing how it helps adapt to changes in project requirements and improve procedures. Tools and approaches like sprint retrospectives, the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle , and lean manufacturing principles support this process of constant enhancement. The goal of continuous improvement is to increase work efficiency, engage employees more, and enhance the quality of products, all while cutting down on waste and expenses. To implement this, organizations plan, try changes on a small scale, review the outcomes, and expand successful adjustments. In the end, continuous improvement encourages a workplace culture focused on growth, flexibility, and excellence.

To increase work efficiency atlassian highlits importance of everyone talking openly and working together. It also mentions checking if the improvements are helping meet the company's goals. Paying attention to:
- The duration from the initiation to the completion of a process or task.
- The time taken to complete one iteration or cycle of a process.
- The number of tasks or items currently being worked on within a process.
- The rate at which tasks or items are completed within a given time frame.

All above helps make informed choices and keep track of the progress. Having a clear way to gather and choose the best ideas can lead to more innovation and work getting done more efficiently. Lastly, it is very important for leaders to support these efforts and for all employees to be involved for these improvement actions to work well.

(Coursera Staff , 2023)
Another source coursera.org also mention continuous improvement as a systematic process of enhancing performance for growth and innovation. Article foucuses on learning from mistakes, and striving for excellence by identifying areas for improvement and implementing small, incremental changes. It suggest" continuous improvement cycle" consists of four stages:
1. Plan,
2. Do,
3. Check,
4. Act,
which are repeated iteratively. Different methods like Lean or Kanban are often used to help with ongoing improvement in managing projects.
- Kanban uses visual tools and a pull system to encourage constant improvement. It helps by making work processes clear, limiting the amount of work being done at once, and improving the speed of tasks.
- Lean methodology, is primarily used for continuous improvement. It focuses on eliminating waste, maximizing efficiency, Encouraging the sharing of ideas and supporting learning among users.

(Halton, 2022)
"Kanban measures success by measuring cycle time, throughput, and work in progress."
Improving collaboration happens because tasks are divided into small Kanban cards, leading to more teamwork with the Kanban method. People, sometimes from different teams, need to work together and talk about moving tasks between sections, and sometimes they need to join forces to quickly solve problems. With Kanban, any changes to how things are done need to be shared with everyone because a change in one place can affect other areas too.
