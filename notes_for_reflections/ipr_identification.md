# How to identify and manage intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, or other legal rights **related to the software being developed.**
There are four main types of intellectual property rights that can be applied to software: patents, trade marks, designs and copyrights.

## Identifying
(cpl.thalesgroup , 2023)
Software intellectual property (IP) is a computer code or program that is protected by law against copying, theft, or unauthorized use by someone else
( Collins, 2021)
- The software must solve a technical problem and provide a technical advantage over existing solutions.
(GOV.UK, 2022)
he article suggests that businesses should use tools like the IP Health Check to find out what intellectual property (IP) they have. It recommends getting help from places like the British Library Business and IP Centre. Doing IP audits or internal checks can also point out important IP assets in the company. It's important to talk to legal experts, like patent or trademark attorneys, to fully understand IP rights. The main point is that businesses need to actively figure out what IP they own to increase their value and stay ahead in the market.

## Protecting IP
(cpl.thalesgroup , 2023)
Protecting IP can significantly benefit business. It ensures I have the exclusive rights to my creations, giving me a competitive advantage as the only innovator in your field. This exclusivity can lead to new income opportunities through licensing or selling my IP. Additionally, I can lower my tax liabilities by deducting research and development expenses linked to my software IP. Keeping an eye on the patent activities of competitors can also provide strategic insights, helping me spot opportunities or threats early on. My software IP can serve as collateral or evidence of value, making it easier to attract investors or secure financing. Implementing strong security measures, such as encryption, further protects my software from cyber threats and unauthorized access, keeping your innovations safe.
( Collins, 2021)
- Trade marks protect words and logos that identify the software, but they do not protect the technical aspects of the software.
- Designs protect the appearance of the software, such as screen displays and graphics, but they do not protect the technical aspects of the software either.
- Copyright protects the source code of the software as a literary work, but it does not protect the ideas contained within it. It arises automatically and is free, but it requires proof of direct copying to establish infringement
(GOV.UK, 2022)
The article explains different ways to keep IP safe. It suggests getting legal help for patents because they are complicated and need to meet specific legal rules. It also mentions the importance of having clear contracts, especially when others create copyright works for me, to make sure who owns what is clear.
Additionally, the article explains the benefits of registering trademarks and designs for better legal protection and how to enforce those rights. It also talks about the importance of keeping business secrets safe with confidentiality agreements.
In short, the article emphasizes the need for businesses to actively look after their IP to increase their value and stay competitive.
