### 30.08.2023
On my first day of school, each one of us students introduced ourselves. After a quick introduction, Neil led a short session on what makes a good stand-up. Following that, each of us began discussing what we had been working on, our upcoming plans, and any challenges we were facing.
#
In the afternoon, I successfully implemented automation into my portfolio project. During a voice chat session, my friend and I introduced two bots to our Discord serverâ€”one from Jira and the other from GitHub
### 31.8-3.9.2023
On Thursday, I participated in a guest lecture session with John from IBM. Following the lecture, we were divided into groups. Unfortunately, my group consisted of people who weren't interested in contributing, so I decided to leave the group and continued working on my private project.
#
Over the weekend, I dedicated my time to my portfolio project. I had a meeting with one of my team members where we discussed issues related to upcoming tasks. During this meeting, I realized that I had unintentionally worked on something unrelated to my assigned task. To resolve this, we decided to merge the work I had already done into the development branch and rebase the branch that my friend was working on to the updated development branch. Fortunately, this process went smoothly because we maintain a respectful and collaborative approach towards both the project and each other. 
### 4.9.2023
I began working on the Drystone project. I established a Jira board and configured the appropriate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages. I then initiated work on the project's user interface (UI).
During the afternoon, I continued my work on the portfolio project. I focused on adding styles and ensuring that the concept I've created remains consistent and well-defined. 
### 5.9.2023
I successfully completed the basic user interface (UI) for the Drystane project. Additionally, I made further enhancements to my private project.
### 6.9.2023
I made good progress today. I successfully implemented a basic script and began debugging events in the school project. For my private portfolio project, I continued to work on styling and added the JSX structure. Additionally, I initiated a reflection related to project time management. 
### 7.9.2023
I had a productive day. I completed the ticket and created a Pull Request for my private project. Following that, I continued searching for evidence to support my reflection. In the Drystane project, I successfully connected the script to the UI and managed to pass values from one textbox to another.
### 8-10.9.2023
Over the weekend, I dedicated time to improving my application and working on my reflection.
### 12.09.2023
During the "Stand Up" meeting, Christopher mentioned that he's capable of providing assistance in languages like C++, C#, and Python, as well as general programming and compiling tasks. He also pointed out that non-trivial data analysis can be performed using Google Colab and Google BigQuery, involving tasks such as uploading CSV files and conducting data analysis.
# 13.9.2023
Today, I managed to finish the project specification, but I would like to check if it is made in the proper way, so I added a ticket on the Jira board.
#
After two hours of focused effort, I successfully completed the application form for the Research Assistant position at Moray UHI and I'm excited about the opportunity.
### 14.9.2023
I successfully synchronized my repositories on GitHub and Bitbucket. Now, any changes I push to GitHub will automatically be mirrored on Bitbucket. This streamlined process will save me time and ensure that my work is consistently backed up.
### 15-17.9.2023
I have found 2 APIs for data analysis. I just need to find one more. I sent 1 pull request for my private project, and I managed to resolve merging conflicts during Sunday's meeting.
### 18-20.9.2023
In the last couple of days, I have been working on a school project related to reflection. I changed my concept, and I am now receiving data from a CSV file and displaying it on the screen. As for my portfolio project, I am currently focused on displaying data that describes past projects and presenting it in the right format within JSX components.
### 21-27.9.2023 
"Over the past week, I've been diligently working on my non-trivial data project, and I successfully managed to create a proof of concept. I displayed two different datasets in the form of charts and could summarize what is presented on the screen.
#
In regard to my private project, I conducted a significant refactor and reorganized the catalog structure. On top of that, I implemented troubleshooting functionality. Whenever the application can't read data from the user, it will use default data, and the same goes for images. If the app cannot find images for the project, it will utilize default ones. Currently, I'm facing a semi-difficult rebase due to all these changes.
### 28.9 - 06.10.2023
Over the last week, I have been working diligently on my portfolio project, and I am close to finishing the alpha version of it. Additionally, I have started a project with a group of students related to security and risks. During a meeting with Neil, I gained an understanding of the differences between threats and risks, which will be beneficial for my reflection. I've had several tempting opportunities related to jobs and other projects over the past week. However, I am committed to maintaining discipline and staying systematic, so I will continue working on my current tasks without starting anything new until I complete them.
### 7 -10.10.2023
Over the last week, I made significant progress in deploying my portfolio app. I successfully set up a pipeline to deploy the code on a virtual private server, which required using tools like Nginx and working with port proxy. I did encounter some issues with the hosting provider, but I managed to resolve them. Additionally, I purchased a domain name, and with the assistance of Cloudflare, I can now access my website using the domain name. I also completed approximately 15 tickets during the week and gained valuable experience in React and TypeScript.
### 10 - 22.10.2023
Last week, I led my team in moving forward to achieve all the planned tasks. I resolved team members' issues in voice chats and created pair programming sessions for the most difficult tasks. Additionally, I updated my portfolio project by finishing tickets one by one, and I completed my reflection on security outcome.
### 22.10 - 2.11.2023
Over the last week, I've actively participated in numerous standups and guest lecture sessions. While I had a brief pause in the school project, I managed to resolve the issue by taking over the ticket and moving it to testing. Additionally, I applied for over 20 developer positions and had one interview along with two video recording interviews. Following a discussion with Karen today, I've decided to maintain daily logs consistently and commit to publishing my work every day.
### 03.10.2023
I discovered an issue in my pipeline: it doesn't pull the new updates from the repository, and after running the pipeline, it doesn't display the correct data. I decided to create a ticket to investigate this.
I communicated with other team members on our Slack channel and I'm looking forward to the 1 pm standup.
I attended the Dev Summit event, and I was highly interested in how developers are striving to implement AI ethics.
I applied for 10 software engineer positions. Following a conversation with HR today, I progressed to another recruiting stage and received an invitation for an on-site meeting.
I had a daily standup meeting with just one team member, where we resolved concerns about the task and the ticket. I suggested reading the ticket description for a better understanding of the task. If, after reading the task description, it remains confusing, I offered my assistance with any issues.
I remined myself how to create epics and story points.

### 06.11.2023
I earned two certificates for learning c# and clean code course.
I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IaMgQkzhWM&t=3205s
about solid Principles
I attended to all team sprint review and ai learned that story points are more
important than I thought. It is a good way to communicate between non technical stake holders
and developers. I will not do much today because I do not feel to well.
### 07.11.2023
I had a 2,5 h interview at life scan
I add comment to PR at school project
I resolved issue with team member during pair programming
### 08.11.2023
I reviewed T-42 for a school project. I also began another reflection about business processes. I contributed to a school project and reviewed multiple PRs. Additionally, I attended a guest lecture about prototypes and wrote some notes.
### 9.11.2023
Today, from the morning, I continued reviewing Pull Requests related to secured routes. With a fresh mind, I noticed that in the Pull Request I accepted yesterday, I found missing files and folders crucial for the project. Another issue arose when I discovered that the tickets moved to the "done" column were never merged with the main branch. I attempted to create a Git request to the database but noticed there is no table or schema in the database. While creating a script, I referred to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createschema.html.
Simultaneously, I was learning about business processes from https://www.villanovau.com/articles/bpm/what-is-a-business-process/ to write my reflection.
### 10.11.2023
After a quick conversation on the Slack channel, a team member informed me that there is no table for unsecured routes, but there is a population database script. I found the script on an unmerged branch. After investigating, I noticed that the script did not have the necessary files to run it. I will need to fix the entire branch and make it executable. I will try to find time to do this in the evening. I received an email from Aviva suggesting that I move to the next stage of the recruiting process. It was a programming challenge that took me 90 minutes plus 45 minutes of preparation. I managed to finish the reflection on business processes, and I am surprised that it is divided into so many parts that are really dependent on each other.
### 13.11.2023
I successfully added the package.json file and installed all dependencies for the database populator. I discovered that I can find database credentials on the Outcome Team's Slack channel.
I initiated a reflection on software quality standards.
Additionally, I watched a video about PostgreSQL from Fireship.
I also made some small progress on my portfolio website.
### 14.11.2023
In the morning, I faced challenges with the database populator as the branch was multiple commits behind. To resolve this, I organized a meeting with a team member and explained how working on branches functions. I clarified the usage of package.json and shared best practices and solutions related to the project. I demonstrated how to add scripts to an existing project, which successfully fixed the issue related to the ticket, and a pull request was made appropriately. Reflecting on this, I realized that considering project participants' skills when starting a new project would save time and prevent the need to explain basic topics repeatedly.
I wrote a significant portion of the reflection about standards. I learned that various ISO standards guide me to deliver better quality products.
On the technical side, I updated the Twitter logo on my portfolio website, changing it to 'X'. I also added styles and a bottom-line section on the ABOUT ME subpage.
### 15.11.2023
Today was not a good day for me, I just managed to chceck one pull request, move forward my reflection little bit and create two small modules for my portfolio.
### 16.11.2023
I started the day by reviewing a pull request, and I approved it. I didn't find any major problems with the database populator. After that, I continued with my ticket 45, where I successfully returned a GET request from an unsecured database. I also noticed that the assumptions for GET requests in unsecured and secured databases differ. I pointed this out in the security-outcome channel and created a pull request for my task, which was approved within a couple of minutes.
I continued my reflection based on the learning outcomes of the quality standards subject. I found a website that allows me to test my website against various standards, and, most importantly, it's free. I summarized the results and found it interesting that my website meets high standards. I am happy that I could write decent code.
I almost finished the 'About Me' section. I think I will complete it tomorrow; it just needs a couple of small bits.
### 17.11.2023
I was actively discussing issues and new features in the Security Outcome channel. I completed a subpage for my portfolio project. I made significant progress on my Learning Outcome Reflection; it just needs referencing, and I will be ready to send it for review. 
### 20.11.2023
I had a job interview with a research bank. I didn't respond to the HR questions as well as I had hoped.
I participated in an "all hands" meeting where all teams had to present their progress. As usual, I felt penalized for putting effort into college collaboration projects.
I completed a ticket for my portfolio project, updating the new Twitter logo with an 'X'. 
### 21.11.2023
Today, since the morning, I was trying to fix the React app created for the Security Outcome project. Although the frontend wasn't included in the project specification, it was developed by one of the participants. I had to search through different branches and gather fragments of code to consolidate them. In the end, I discovered multiple 'node_modules', and the code did not run even with the instructions provided at https://copyprogramming.com/howto/run-create-react-app-from-sub-folder.
I believe the best solution is to separate the React app into its own folder. Once the build is created, I can run it from the server in the main repository. On another note, I added references and corrected grammar and spelling mistakes in my reflection.
