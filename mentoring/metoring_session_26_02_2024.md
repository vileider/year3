Abstract Class
If I have an abstract class, it simply means there is at least one method undefined. Depending on the programming language, there is a different methodology:
Abstract class in C++:
-Virtual class

One of the key aspects of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is that the type written in the file and the type in the object run can be treated differently.
The way the methods are actually invoked is more complicated than I think.
When I write a code to the CPU, I push variables to the stack, and then I perform operations that are calling from the stack.

The difference between an interface and an abstract class is that an interface is completely undefined, specifying just what returns and method names.
