The Factory pattern allows you to create a common interface that can be used to instantiate objects from a family of classes. Essentially, it enables you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the specific type of objects that need to be created can vary based on different conditions or configurations.

"Explain what is meant by managing up and across the organisation, assessing people considerations".:

Francesco explained to me his point of view:

When you're in a position where you have to report to higher-ups in the company structure, there's often a challenge with meeting expectations. Basically, the company expects you to complete the tasks you're responsible for. But there's also the personal goals of the people you report to, and the person above them has their own goals too. It's important to understand the goals of your superiors.

If there's an expectation to deliver a product in 2 weeks and there's another project also due in 2 weeks, it's your job to communicate clearly with your superiors about what's realistic. Being honest and having good negotiation skills are crucial.

It's a two-way street. If you're a middle manager, you need to meet your manager's expectations and also manage and assign work to others.

Knowing the company's structure helps you set realistic deadlines within the hierarchy.

Quoting Francesco Burato "the code is for people to read, not computers." This highlights the importance of writing clear and understandable code, not just code that works. Good comments in the code explain not only what is done but also why it is done that way, including the purpose behind using certain variables. This approach makes it easier for others (and myself in the future) to understand the reasoning behind code decisions, making maintenance and updates much smoother.

Instruction sets, like those in assembly language (Assembler), are closer to the machine's language. They're a set of instructions that a computer's processor understands and can execute directly. These instructions are very basic and low-level, designed to be executed by the CPU without needing translation or interpretation, which makes them fast and efficient. However, they are harder for humans to read and understand compared to higher-level programming languages.

Micro-operations, on the other hand, are even more granular actions that occur within the CPU. They are the detailed steps that the processor takes to execute each instruction in the instruction set. These can include operations like fetching an instruction from memory, decoding the instruction to understand what action is required, executing the action, and then writing the result back to memory or a register. Understanding micro-operations is essential for designing and optimizing processor architecture but is typically abstracted away from the programmer's view, especially in high-level programming.
