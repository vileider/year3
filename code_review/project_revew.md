I arranged a meeting with Jason and Andy, asking for help in organizing our project. Their experience in the industry and working on large projects can be priceless for our game project. Their suggestions included:

* For managing my project, incorporating both render and update functions is recommended. These functions are crucial for separating the drawing of my application's interface from updating its state, ensuring smooth and efficient performance.

* Combining the event handler and observer functionalities into a single class can streamline the codebase. This approach allows for more integrated handling of events and notifications within my system, reducing complexity and enhancing code maintainability.

* Examining game architectures, such as those used in Minecraft and Stardew Valley, can provide valuable insights. These games excel in creating immersive worlds with dynamic content, partly due to their effective use of architectural patterns that manage game state, rendering, and user interactions efficiently.

* It is important to maintain debugging values within your environment variables. This practice ensures that your application can be tested and debugged in a controlled manner without cluttering your class definitions with unnecessary debug information. Keeping only essential values within your classes helps in maintaining clean, readable, and maintainable code.

* For further reading and understanding, they provided links from the meeting points to the Decorator Pattern on Wikipedia and more.
