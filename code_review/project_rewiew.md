For managing your project, incorporating both render and update functions is recommended. These functions are crucial for separating the drawing of your application's interface from updating its state, ensuring smooth and efficient performance.

Combining the event handler and observer functionalities into a single class can streamline your codebase. This approach allows for a more integrated handling of events and notifications within your system, reducing complexity and enhancing code maintainability.

Looking at game architectures, such as those used in Minecraft and Stardew Valley, can provide valuable insights. These games excel in creating immersive worlds with dynamic content, partly due to their effective use of architectural patterns that manage game state, rendering, and user interactions efficiently.

It's important to maintain debugging values within your environment variables. This practice ensures that your application can be tested and debuged in a controlled manner without cluttering your class definitions with unnecessary debug information. Keeping only essential values within your classes helps in maintaining clean, readable, and maintainable code.
